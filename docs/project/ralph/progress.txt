(Patterns discovered during feature builds)

## Iteration 1: US-001 Add Schema Fields (COMPLETE)
Date: 2026-01-22 22:05

**Implementation:**
- Added 6 new optional fields to service-city schema (src/content/config.ts):
  - hero: {title, description} for city-specific H1s and intro copy
  - finalCta: {headline, copy} for conversion-focused CTAs
  - benefitsHeadline: string for unique H2
  - contextHeadline: string for unique H2
  - experienceStats: {installationsInCity, yearsSinceCityStart} for E-E-A-T
- Removed processSteps field from service-city schema (now inherits from parent service)
- Updated src/pages/services/[serviceLocation].astro to only use serviceData.processSteps
- Build verification: 639 pages generated successfully

**Schema Location:**
src/content/config.ts lines 641-670 (Phase 8A fields block)

**Next Story:**
US-002: Update Components for City-Specific Content (requires /frontend-design skill)

## Iteration 5: US-002 Update Components for City-Specific Content (COMPLETE)
Date: 2026-01-23 11:40

**Implementation:**
- Discovered all 4 components (ServiceHeroSection, FinalCTASection, ServiceBenefitsSection, ContextSection) ALREADY have Phase 8A props integrated
- No code changes required - props were added in previous work

**Verification:**
1. /frontend-design skill: Created design spec confirming implementation complete
2. /web-design-guidelines review: All 4 components pass (proper H1 hierarchy, semantic HTML, accessibility)
3. /agent-browser testing: Tested 3 Guelph pages
   - furnace-installation-guelph-on: Internal links work, H1 count = 1 ✓
   - heat-pump-installation-guelph-on: Internal links work, H1 count = 1 ✓
   - air-conditioner-installation-guelph-on: Internal links work, H1 count = 1 ✓
4. pnpm build: 639 pages generated successfully ✓

**Key Findings:**
- Parent service links navigate correctly: /services/[serviceLocation] → /services/[service]
- Location hub links navigate correctly: /services/[serviceLocation] → /locations/[location]
- H1 hierarchy enforced: ONLY ServiceHeroSection renders H1, all other components use H2
- Internal links conditionally rendered (only on service-city pages with all 4 props)

**Next Story:**
US-003: Fix LocationServicesGrid Bug (requires /frontend-design skill)
