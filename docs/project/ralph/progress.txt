## US-001: Run Orchestrator for Guelph Content Strategy

**Orchestrator Output:**

Recommended skill sequence for generating 22 Guelph service-city pages:

1. **keyword-research** - Identify target keywords for all 22 services in Guelph market
2. **positioning-angles** - Find differentiation angles specific to Guelph (climate, housing, local factors)
3. **brand-voice** - Extract/validate voice profile from existing content
4. **seo-content** - Generate problem sections (SEO-optimized with keywords)
5. **direct-response-copy** - Generate trustOpener, solution, benefits (conversion-focused)

**Workflow:** orchestrator → keyword-research → positioning-angles → brand-voice → seo-content → direct-response-copy

**Context passing strategy:**
- FULL CONTEXT: brand-voice → all skills, positioning → direct-response-copy, keywords → seo-content
- LIGHT CONTEXT: positioning → seo-content (summary only), keywords → direct-response-copy (main terms only)
- FRESH START: If output feels generic, re-run with minimal context for boldness

**Quality gates:** NO em dashes (grep check), uniqueness verification, city-specificity check

**Next:** US-002 will run keyword-research skill as routed by orchestrator.
