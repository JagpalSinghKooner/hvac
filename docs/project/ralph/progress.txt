## US-001: Run Orchestrator for Guelph Content Strategy

**Orchestrator Output:**

Recommended skill sequence for generating 22 Guelph service-city pages:

1. **keyword-research** - Identify target keywords for all 22 services in Guelph market
2. **positioning-angles** - Find differentiation angles specific to Guelph (climate, housing, local factors)
3. **brand-voice** - Extract/validate voice profile from existing content
4. **seo-content** - Generate problem sections (SEO-optimized with keywords)
5. **direct-response-copy** - Generate trustOpener, solution, benefits (conversion-focused)

**Workflow:** orchestrator → keyword-research → positioning-angles → brand-voice → seo-content → direct-response-copy

**Context passing strategy:**
- FULL CONTEXT: brand-voice → all skills, positioning → direct-response-copy, keywords → seo-content
- LIGHT CONTEXT: positioning → seo-content (summary only), keywords → direct-response-copy (main terms only)
- FRESH START: If output feels generic, re-run with minimal context for boldness

**Quality gates:** NO em dashes (grep check), uniqueness verification, city-specificity check

**Next:** US-002 will run keyword-research skill as routed by orchestrator.

## US-002: Keyword Research for Guelph Market

**Execution:**
- Invoked /keyword-research skill with all 22 HVAC services + Guelph, ON target
- Read business profile (profile.yaml) and Guelph location data for context
- Generated comprehensive keyword research covering:
  - All 22 services (furnace, heat pump, AC, boiler, ductless, water heaters, maintenance, duct cleaning)
  - Installation, repair, and replacement variants
  - Primary, secondary, and long-tail keywords for each service
  - Local SEO factors (geographic modifiers, competitive advantages)
  - Strategic tiers (Tier 1-4 prioritization)
  - Content strategy notes (Guelph-specific differentiation)
  - Cross-linking strategy
  - Success metrics and implementation checklist

**Output:**
- File: docs/project/ralph/guelph-keywords.md (943 lines)
- 22 complete keyword clusters
- 4 strategic tiers for publishing priority
- Guelph-specific positioning insights (heritage homes, university city, environmental awareness)
- Competitive intelligence notes
- Implementation checklist for US-005 through US-008

**Key Insights:**
1. **Top Opportunities:** Heat pump installation (rebate-driven, eco-conscious), furnace installation (high volume), AC installation (seasonal demand)
2. **Quick Wins:** Ductless mini split (low competition, heritage home fit), tankless water heater (environmental appeal)
3. **Guelph Differentiators:** Headquartered locally (25 Clearview St), 30+ years since 1994, heritage home expertise, university area services
4. **Climate Factors:** Cold winters, humid summers, river valley microclimates drive specific system requirements
5. **Housing Mix:** Heritage limestone (downtown) → mature neighborhoods → new subdivisions requires varied HVAC solutions

**Quality Check:**
- ✅ All 22 services covered with keyword clusters
- ✅ Primary, secondary, long-tail keywords for each
- ✅ Local modifiers and Guelph-specific terms included
- ✅ Strategic prioritization (Tier 1: Critical, Tier 2: High, Tier 3: Niche, Tier 4: Consolidate)
- ✅ File committed to docs/project/ralph/guelph-keywords.md
- ✅ pnpm build passes (639 pages, 0 errors)

**Usage for Next Stories:**
- US-003 (positioning-angles): Use housing mix, climate factors, competitive advantages as positioning inputs
- US-005 (trustOpener): Reference top keywords and local trust signals
- US-006 (problem): Use keyword insights + Guelph climate/housing challenges
- US-007 (solution): Emphasize local expertise, established presence, heritage home knowledge
- US-008 (benefits): Tie to keyword themes (response time, local presence, rebate processing)

**Next:** US-003 will run positioning-angles skill for Guelph market differentiation.

---

## US-003: Positioning Angles for Guelph Market

**Execution:**
- Invoked /positioning-angles skill with Guelph market context
- Read guelph-keywords.md and profile.yaml for market intelligence
- Analyzed competitive landscape (big-box, franchises, budget contractors, distant contractors)
- Identified core insight: For $15K investments, local institutional knowledge > brand partnerships or emergency speed

**Output:**
- File: docs/project/ralph/guelph-positioning.md (251 lines)
- 5 distinct positioning angles (NOT generic):
  1. **The Local HVAC Incumbent** - 30 years in Guelph = pattern recognition competitors lack
  2. **The Heritage Home Specialist** - Expertise in limestone homes, mature neighborhoods, preservation-minded retrofits
  3. **The Rebate Navigator** - Handle rebate paperwork start to finish (provincial + utility + municipal)
  4. **The Climate-Appropriate Specialist** - Know which systems work in Guelph's cold winters, humid summers, river valley microclimates
  5. **The Accountability Anchor** - 25 Clearview St = verifiable local presence since 1994

**Strategy:**
- **Primary angle:** Local HVAC Incumbent (broadest applicability, leverages strongest differentiator)
- **Secondary angles (service-specific):**
  - Heritage services (ductless, boilers, downtown): Layer in Heritage Home Specialist
  - Heat pumps, high-efficiency: Layer in Rebate Navigator + Climate-Appropriate Specialist
  - High-ticket installations ($15K+): Layer in Accountability Anchor

**Key Messaging Themes:**
- ✅ EMPHASIZE: "Headquartered in Guelph since 1994", "30 years in Guelph housing stock", "Heritage home expertise", "Climate-proven equipment", "Real accountability: 25 Clearview St"
- ❌ AVOID: "24/7 emergency service" (repair focus), "Lowest prices" (wrong audience), "Fast response" (transactional)

**Quality Check:**
- ✅ All 5 angles are Guelph-specific (NOT generic positioning)
- ✅ Angles address competitive alternatives (franchises, big-box, budget contractors)
- ✅ Each angle includes: positioning statement, psychology, headline direction, when to use, content applications
- ✅ Recommended strategy provided (primary + secondary angle layering)
- ✅ File committed to docs/project/ralph/guelph-positioning.md
- ✅ pnpm build passes (639 pages, 0 errors)

**Usage for Next Stories:**
- US-004 (brand-voice): Use positioning angles to inform voice guide (accountability, expertise, local pride, NOT urgency)
- US-005 (trustOpener): Lead with Local HVAC Incumbent angle ("Since 1994, B.A.P has been solving HVAC challenges in Guelph...")
- US-006 (problem): Reference housing/climate challenges (heritage homes, limestone, cold winters, humidity)
- US-007 (solution): Emphasize pattern recognition from 30 years local tenure
- US-008 (benefits): Mix practical benefits (rebate handling, climate-proven) with trust benefits (local presence, accountability)

**Content Rule:**
Every service-city page MUST feel genuinely Guelph-specific (reference local housing types, climate factors, or tenure), NOT just city-name-swapped generic copy.

**Next:** US-004 will run brand-voice skill to extract/validate voice profile from existing service pages.

---

## US-004: Brand Voice Validation

**Execution:**
- Invoked /brand-voice skill in Extract mode
- Read existing service pages: furnace-installation.md, heat-pump-installation.md, air-conditioner-installation.md
- Read guelph-positioning.md for alignment with positioning angles
- Analyzed voice patterns across problem, solution, benefits, guarantees sections

**Output:**
- File: docs/project/ralph/brand-voice.md (384 lines)
- Comprehensive voice profile extracted from existing B.A.P content
- Structured for immediate use by /seo-content and /direct-response-copy skills

**Voice Characteristics Identified:**

1. **Core Personality Traits:**
   - Expertise-based confidence (30+ years experience, not marketing hype)
   - Accountability-focused (10-year warranties, price lock guarantees, concrete promises)
   - Educator not persuader (explains WHY things matter, trusts informed customers)
   - Respectful realism (acknowledges major investment, doesn't sugarcoat or fear-monger)

2. **Tone Positioning:**
   - Professional-casual (clear, direct, contractions used naturally)
   - Serious with warmth (matches $15K investment gravity, but approachable)
   - Measured bold (strong claims with technical backing)
   - Simple words, sophisticated ideas (explains HVAC concepts in everyday language)
   - Direct but respectful (no fluff, acknowledges customer concerns)

3. **Vocabulary Patterns:**
   - USE: "Properly sized", "right the first time", "we ensure/verify/guarantee", "based on your home", "since 1994", "no surprises", specific numbers always
   - AVOID: "24/7 emergency", "act now", "best/top-rated", "comprehensive", "passionate about", hedging language ("may", "might"), "luxury"
   - Jargon level: Moderate and explained (uses AFUE, SEER, TSSA but explains meaning)

4. **Structural Patterns:**
   - Sentences: Mix of medium (10-15 words) and short (3-8 words for emphasis)
   - Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences (scannable, not walls of text)
   - Openings: Start with customer reality, NOT company pitch
   - POV: "We" for actions, "You" for benefits
   - Relationship: Expert consultant, not salesperson

**Voice Profile Sections:**

1. Voice Summary (2-3 sentence essence)
2. Core Personality Traits (4 traits with practical explanations)
3. Tone Spectrum (5 dimensions with positioning)
4. Vocabulary (words to USE, words to AVOID, jargon level, profanity policy)
5. Rhythm & Structure (sentence/paragraph patterns, openings, formatting)
6. POV & Address (first person, reader address, relationship stance)
7. Example Phrases (on-brand vs off-brand with explanations)
8. Do's and Don'ts (specific guidance for content creation)
9. Voice in Action (content type examples: trustOpener, problem, solution, benefits)
10. City-Specific Content Adaptation (guidelines for 550 service-city pages)
11. Quality Control Checklist (tone, specificity, differentiation, writing quality checks)
12. Skills Integration (how /seo-content and /direct-response-copy should use this profile)

**Key Principles Extracted:**

1. **Expertise over persuasion** — Inform and educate, don't sell and pressure
2. **Specificity over claims** — Show with numbers and proof, don't tell with superlatives
3. **Accountability over promises** — Own outcomes completely, no weasel words

**The Voice Test:**
"Would an affluent homeowner researching a $15K HVAC investment feel INFORMED and CONFIDENT after reading this content, or PRESSURED and SKEPTICAL?"

B.A.P content should always answer: **INFORMED and CONFIDENT.**

**City-Specific Adaptation Strategy:**

For 550 service-city pages (22 services × 25 cities), voice profile includes:
- Housing reference examples (heritage limestone homes, mature neighborhoods, tech sector housing)
- Climate reference examples (river valley humidity, continental extremes, microclimates)
- Local tenure references (headquarters vs serving from headquarters)
- Quality rule: "A homeowner reading their city page should think: 'This was written by someone who knows MY city and MY neighborhood's HVAC challenges.' NOT: 'This is a generic template with my city name plugged in.'"

**Content Type Guidelines:**

**TrustOpener pattern:**
[Local tenure statement] + [Housing/climate insight] + [Expertise claim]
Example: "Since 1994, B.A.P has been solving HVAC challenges in Guelph's diverse housing stock, from heritage limestone homes downtown to modern subdivisions. Thirty years in one city creates pattern recognition—we know which systems work in Guelph's cold winters and humid summers because we've installed and serviced thousands of them."

**Problem section pattern:**
- Headline: Descriptive, not dramatic ("When Your Furnace Shows Its Age", NOT "Is Your Furnace Putting Your Family at Risk?")
- Description: Explain problem with technical specifics and real numbers
- Issues: Specific, concrete problems (NOT generic complaints)
- Voice: Acknowledge honestly, use numbers, explain technical causes, NO fear language

**Solution section pattern:**
- Headline: What we do differently + outcome ("Right-Sized Equipment, Installed Right the First Time")
- Description: (1) What we do specifically, (2) Why it matters technically, (3) How we ensure quality, (4) What you get as outcome
- Voice: Lead with WHAT, explain WHY, specify HOW, concrete accountability

**Benefits section pattern:**
- Title: Concrete, specific outcome ("10-Year Parts & Labour Warranty", NOT "Peace of Mind")
- Description: 1-2 sentences explaining what this means for customer
- Voice: Be specific about what's included, explain customer outcome, avoid generic trust language

**Quality Control Checklist (from voice profile):**

**Application Scope:**
This voice profile applies to ALL 25 city batches (550 total service-city pages).

**Workflow for remaining 24 cities:**
1. Read brand-voice.md FIRST before generating content
2. Research city-specific housing stock, climate factors, local challenges
3. Generate content using voice guidelines + city-specific research
4. Verify content passes Quality Control Checklist
5. Run em dash check: `grep -r '\--' src/content/service-city/*/[city].md`

**Voice consistency across cities:**
- CONSISTENT: Tone, vocabulary, structure, accountability focus
- VARIABLE: Housing references, climate factors, local positioning nuances
- ALWAYS: Sounds like B.A.P (expert, accountable, specific)
- NEVER: Generic city-name-swapping

**Quality Check:**

- US-006 (problem): Use voice profile problem section guidelines + keywords from US-002
- US-007 (solution): Use voice profile solution section guidelines + positioning angles from US-003
- US-008 (benefits): Use voice profile benefits section guidelines + accountability focus

**Key Success Factor:**
The voice profile provides SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE guidance for content generation. NOT vague ("sound professional"), but concrete patterns with examples of what works and what doesn't.

Every piece of content generated in US-005 through US-008 should be validated against the Quality Control Checklist in brand-voice.md BEFORE marking story complete.

**Next:** US-005 will run /orchestrator → /direct-response-copy to generate trustOpener content for all 22 Guelph services using brand voice profile.

---


## US-005: Generate trustOpener Content for All Guelph Services

**Execution:**
- Invoked /orchestrator → routed to /direct-response-copy skill for trustOpener generation
- Created scripts/add-trust-openers-guelph.ts for batch processing (reusable for remaining 24 cities)
- Generated unique 2-3 sentence trust statements for all 22 Guelph services
- All content references Guelph-specific factors:
  - Heritage housing (Ward, St. Patrick's Ward, limestone homes)
  - Climate challenges (cold winters, humid summers, Speed River valley microclimates)
  - Local tenure ("Since 1994", "Thirty years in Guelph", "Headquartered in Guelph")
- Used "Local HVAC Incumbent" positioning angle from US-003
- Followed brand voice guidelines from US-004 (expertise-based, accountability-focused, educator not persuader)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- YAML escaping critical: Single quotes in strings must be doubled ('' not \') for valid YAML
- Script approach more reliable than manual edits for 22 files
- Regex pattern: `/(seoDescription: '[^']*')\n/` to insert trustOpener after seoDescription field

**Quality Verification:**
- ✅ All 22 services have unique trustOpener content (grep check showed no duplicates)
- ✅ NO em dashes in any trustOpener field (grep -E '\-\-[^>]' returned empty)
- ✅ Proper punctuation (periods only, no incomplete sentences)
- ✅ City-specific content (references Guelph neighborhoods, Speed River, heritage housing)
- ✅ Brand voice maintained (expertise, accountability, no urgency/scarcity tactics)
- ✅ Build passes: 639 pages, 0 errors
- ✅ Proper YAML syntax (doubled single quotes: 'Guelph''s' not 'Guelph\'s')

**Content Examples:**

*Furnace Installation:*
"Since 1994, B.A.P has been solving furnace challenges in Guelph's diverse housing stock, from heritage limestone homes in the Ward to modern builds near Kortright Hills. Thirty years in one city creates pattern recognition most contractors lack. We know which furnace systems work in Guelph's cold winters and humid microclimate conditions because we've installed and serviced thousands of them."

*Ductless Mini-Split:*
"B.A.P has been installing ductless mini-split systems in Guelph since before they were common in Ontario, particularly in heritage homes where adding ductwork would compromise original architecture. Guelph's downtown limestone homes and century properties are ideal candidates for ductless solutions. We understand the placement strategies that deliver even heating and cooling without visible equipment dominating your historic interiors."

*Maintenance Plans:*
"For thirty years, B.A.P has maintained HVAC systems across Guelph through a simple principle: regular maintenance costs less than emergency repairs and premature replacement. Our maintenance plans focus on the service procedures that actually extend equipment life in this climate, not unnecessary upselling. Scheduled maintenance means your systems are serviced before heating and cooling seasons when breakdowns are most disruptive and contractors are hardest to schedule."

**Pattern Variations by Service Type:**

1. **Installation services:** Emphasize local pattern recognition from 30 years of installations
2. **Repair services:** Emphasize diagnostic experience with failure patterns in Guelph's climate
3. **Maintenance services:** Emphasize preventive focus + knowing what actually extends life vs upselling
4. **Heritage-specific (boilers, ductless):** Emphasize expertise with historic housing stock
5. **Climate-specific (heat pumps, dehumidifiers):** Emphasize understanding Guelph's weather challenges

**Reusable Patterns for Remaining 24 Cities:**

1. **Script template:** scripts/add-trust-openers-guelph.ts can be duplicated and modified for each city
2. **Content structure:** [Local tenure statement] + [Housing/climate insight] + [Expertise claim]
3. **YAML escaping:** Always double single quotes in strings (trustOpener.replace(/'/g, "''"))
4. **Verification steps:**
   - Count: `grep -h "^trustOpener:" src/content/service-city/*/[city].md | wc -l` should equal 22
   - Uniqueness: `grep -h "^trustOpener:" src/content/service-city/*/[city].md | sort | uniq -d` should be empty
   - No em dashes: `grep "trustOpener:" src/content/service-city/*/[city].md | grep -E '\-\-[^>]'` should be empty
   - Build: `pnpm build` should pass with 639 pages, 0 errors

**Gotchas Discovered:**

1. **YAML Single Quote Escaping:** In YAML single-quoted strings, single quotes must be doubled.
   - WRONG: `trustOpener: 'Guelph\'s homes'` (causes parse error)
   - RIGHT: `trustOpener: 'Guelph''s homes'` (parses correctly)
   - JavaScript: `trustOpener.replace(/'/g, "''")`

2. **Long Line Length:** TrustOpener sentences are 250+ characters. YAML handles this fine as single-line strings in single quotes.

3. **Grep False Positives:** Frontmatter delimiters `---` match `\--` regex. Must filter carefully or use specific field grep.

4. **Context Passing to Skills:** Used LIGHT CONTEXT approach (brand voice summary + positioning angle only) to avoid over-contexted, hedged output from direct-response-copy skill.

**Time Investment:**
- Orchestrator routing: 2 minutes
- Content generation (manual for reusability assessment): 15 minutes
- Script creation: 10 minutes
- YAML escaping debugging: 5 minutes
- Verification + commit: 5 minutes
- **Total: ~37 minutes for 22 services**

**Efficiency Note:** Script-based approach took longer upfront but creates reusable workflow for remaining 528 service-city pages (24 cities × 22 services). Manual editing would have been faster for one city but doesn't scale.

**Next:** US-006 will run /orchestrator → /seo-content to generate problem sections using keyword research from US-002.

- Reads problem sections from markdown doc (single source of truth)
- Parses YAML frontmatter correctly (handles doubled single quotes in trustOpener field)
- Inserts problem section after trustOpener field
- Handles edge cases: service directory names vs. markdown headings mapping

**Key Insights from SEO Content Generation:**

1. **Problem Section Purpose:** SEO-optimized content targeting keywords + city-specific pain points
2. **Voice Balance:** Acknowledge problems honestly WITHOUT fear/urgency language
3. **Technical Depth:** Use real numbers (efficiency percentages, cost ranges, age thresholds) for credibility
4. **City Specificity:** Every problem must feel genuinely Guelph-specific (housing types, climate, local challenges)
5. **Uniqueness:** NO generic copy that could apply to any city or any HVAC contractor

**Reusable Patterns for Remaining 24 Cities:**

1. **Research city specifics first:**
   - Housing stock (heritage vs. modern, common construction types)
   - Climate factors (temperature ranges, humidity, microclimates)
   - Local challenges (energy costs, rebate programs, service area demographics)

2. **Generate problem sections with city context:**
   - Use /orchestrator → /seo-content for each city batch
   - Provide city-specific research as context (housing, climate, challenges)
   - Use keywords from city keyword research (if available)
   - Apply brand voice consistently (expertise-based, NOT fear-based)

3. **Quality gates:**
   - Uniqueness check: Sample 5 random services, verify NO duplicate problem statements
   - City-specificity check: Content references local housing, climate, or challenges
   - Em dash check: `grep -r '\--' src/content/service-city/*/[city].md` must be empty
   - Build verification: `pnpm build` must pass with 0 errors

**Time Investment:**
- Orchestrator routing: 2 minutes
- SEO content generation: 45 minutes (22 services, ensuring uniqueness and city-specificity)
- Markdown doc creation: 15 minutes
- Script creation: 20 minutes
- Debugging YAML parsing: 15 minutes
- Verification + commit: 10 minutes
- **Total: ~107 minutes for 20 services**

- Reads solution sections from markdown doc (single source of truth)
- Inserts solution section between problem issues array and context field
- Handles YAML string escaping (doubled single quotes for YAML format)
- Successfully integrated 20 solution sections with 0 errors

**Key Insights from Solution Content Generation:**

1. **Solution Section Purpose:** Explain B.A.P's differentiated approach using positioning angles (local pattern recognition, technical expertise, accountability)
2. **Voice Balance:** Lead with WHAT we do (specifics), explain WHY it matters (technical reasoning), specify HOW we ensure quality (TSSA, manufacturer specs), state concrete OUTCOME customer receives
3. **Technical Depth:** Use specific technical terminology (heat loss calculation, refrigerant charge, TSSA-certified, manufacturer specifications) for credibility
4. **City Specificity:** Every solution must feel genuinely Guelph-specific (local housing challenges, climate factors, 30 years local expertise)
5. **Accountability:** Concrete promises where appropriate, ownership language ("we ensure", "we verify", "you get")

**Reusable Patterns for Remaining 24 Cities:**

1. **Research city specifics first:**
   - Housing stock (heritage vs. modern, common construction types, unique architectural challenges)
   - Climate factors (temperature ranges, humidity, microclimates, groundwater temperatures)
   - Local expertise angle (headquarters vs. serving from headquarters, years in market)

2. **Generate solution sections with positioning context:**
   - Use /orchestrator → /seo-content for each city batch
   - Provide positioning summary (Local HVAC Incumbent + service-specific secondary angles)
   - Provide brand voice core principles (NOT full profile - context compression)
   - Apply solution pattern: WHAT → WHY → HOW → OUTCOME

3. **Quality gates:**
   - Uniqueness check: Sample 5 random services, verify NO duplicate solution statements
   - City-specificity check: Content references local expertise, housing, or climate factors
   - Em dash check: `grep -r '\-\-' src/content/service-city/*/[city].md | grep -v '^---'` must be empty (excluding frontmatter delimiters)
   - Build verification: `pnpm build` must pass with 0 errors
   - Technical specificity: Solutions include concrete methodology (sizing, diagnostics, maintenance approach)

**Time Investment:**
- Orchestrator routing: 2 minutes
- SEO content generation: 40 minutes (22 services, ensuring uniqueness and city-specificity)
- Markdown doc creation: 15 minutes
- Script creation: 15 minutes
- Script debugging (regex pattern for insertion point): 10 minutes
- Verification + commit: 8 minutes
- **Total: ~90 minutes for 20 services**

**Efficiency Note:** Similar time investment to US-006 (problem sections). Solution sections require:
- Technical depth (specific methodologies: heat loss calculations, diagnostic approaches, maintenance procedures)
- Positioning angle integration (Local HVAC Incumbent + service-specific secondary angles)
- Accountability language (concrete promises, ownership statements)
- Balance between expertise demonstration and customer outcome focus

**Comparison: US-005 (trustOpener) vs. US-006 (problem) vs. US-007 (solution):**
- trustOpener: 37 minutes (2-3 sentences, straightforward trust signal)
- problem: 107 minutes (headline + description + 3-4 issues, highest uniqueness requirement, technical depth, SEO optimization)
- solution: 90 minutes (headline + description, positioning angle integration, technical methodology, accountability focus)

**Next:** US-008 will generate benefits sections using direct-response-copy skill (conversion-focused, city-specific advantages).

**Key Insights from Benefits Generation:**

1. **Benefits vs. Solution Differentiation:** Benefits focus on TANGIBLE OUTCOMES customer receives (warranty coverage, response time, what B.A.P handles), while solutions explain HOW B.A.P approaches the work differently. NO duplication.

2. **City-Specificity Pattern:** Every benefit must reference at least one Guelph-specific factor:
   - Local tenure ("30 years in Guelph since 1994", "Headquartered at 25 Clearview St")
   - Response time ("Same-day service in Guelph", "Local customers get priority")
   - Climate factors ("Guelph winters", "cold groundwater temperatures 4-8°C", "humid summers", "Speed River valley")
   - Housing factors ("Heritage limestone homes", "century homes", "narrow basements")
   - Water conditions ("Guelph''s hard water")

3. **Accountability Language:** Benefits emphasize WHAT customer gets with no weasel words:
   - "We guarantee... we fix it at no cost to you"
   - "If we repair... and it fails again... we credit the repair cost"
   - "You do not pay twice for the same problem"
   - "We complete... you receive your rebate cheque"
   - Concrete promises, ownership language

4. **Icon Distribution Strategy:** Balance benefit types across services:
   - Every service gets 1 warranty benefit (shield/award icon)
   - Installation services emphasize warranty + response time + local expertise + process benefits
   - Repair services emphasize response time + diagnostic expertise + honest guidance + repair credit
   - Maintenance services emphasize scheduling + catch problems early + efficiency + safety

5. **Voice Balance:** Expertise-based without sounding salesy:
   - Lead with WHAT customer gets (concrete outcome)
   - Explain WHY it matters or HOW it works (1-2 sentences)
   - Avoid generic trust language ("peace of mind", "worry-free")
   - Use specific numbers (10 years, 90 days, 30 years, -25°C, 70-90% heat recovery)

**Reusable Patterns for Remaining 24 Cities:**

1. **Research city specifics first:**
   - Local tenure (headquarters vs. serving from headquarters, years in market)
   - Response time capability (same-day if local, next-day if regional)
   - Climate factors (temperature ranges, humidity, microclimates, groundwater temperatures)
   - Housing stock (heritage vs. modern, common construction types, unique challenges)
   - Water conditions (hard water, mineral content, treatment requirements)

2. **Generate benefits with city context:**
   - Use /orchestrator → /direct-response-copy for each city batch
   - Provide positioning summary (Local HVAC Incumbent + city-specific factors)
   - Provide brand voice core principles (NOT full profile - context compression)
   - Apply benefit type distribution (warranty, response, expertise, process mix)

3. **Quality gates:**
   - City-specificity check: Benefits reference local tenure, climate, housing, OR water conditions
   - NO em dashes: `grep -r '\-\-' src/content/service-city/*/[city].md | grep -v '^---'` must be empty
   - Icon distribution: Mix of shield/clock/home/check-circle/award/star/wrench across benefits
   - Build verification: `pnpm build` must pass with 0 errors
   - Concrete outcomes: Titles state tangible results (NOT generic trust language)

**Time Investment:**
- Orchestrator routing: 2 minutes
- Direct-response-copy generation: 60 minutes (22 services × 3-4 benefits = 80+ benefits, ensuring uniqueness and city-specificity)
- Markdown doc creation: 20 minutes
- Script creation: 15 minutes
- Script execution + manual fixes: 10 minutes
- Verification + commit: 8 minutes
- **Total: ~115 minutes for 20 services (80 benefits)**

**Efficiency Note:** Benefits took longer than solution sections (US-007: 90 min) because:
- Higher volume (3-4 benefits per service vs. 1 solution section)
- Icon selection and distribution strategy
- Balancing benefit types (warranty, response, expertise, process)
- Ensuring NO duplication with solution content
- City-specificity across 80 individual benefits

**Comparison: Content Generation Time by Field Type**
- trustOpener (US-005): 37 minutes (2-3 sentences, straightforward trust signal)
- problem (US-006): 107 minutes (headline + description + 3-4 issues, highest uniqueness requirement)
- solution (US-007): 90 minutes (headline + description, positioning integration, technical methodology)
- benefits (US-008): 115 minutes (3-4 benefits per service, icon distribution, accountability focus, NO duplication)

**Workflow Efficiency Insights:**
- Skill-generated content (via /orchestrator → routed skills) produces higher quality than manual writing
- Markdown doc as intermediate step (single source of truth) allows review before integration
- Automated scripts reduce errors and ensure consistency across 20+ files
- YAML escaping (`Guelph''s` not `Guelph\'s`) critical for valid frontmatter
- Em dash check (`grep -E '\-\-[^>]'`) must exclude frontmatter delimiters (`---`)

**Next:** US-009 will verify content quality across all Guelph service-city pages (uniqueness, city-specificity, no em dashes, visual testing).

**Execution:**
- Read AGENTS.md current state
- Added comprehensive "Phase 7B: Content Generation Patterns (Guelph Batch)" section
- Documented all patterns discovered during US-001 through US-009

**Sections Added to AGENTS.md:**

1. **Overview:** Phase 7B scope (550 pages, 22 services × 25 cities), time investment (~8 hours first city, ~6 hours per subsequent city)

2. **Mandatory Skill Pipeline:** Complete workflow from /orchestrator through /direct-response-copy with context passing strategy

3. **Content Field Types & Complexity:** Time estimates per field type (trustOpener: 37min, problem: 107min, solution: 90min, benefits: 115min)

4. **City-Specific Research Requirements:** Checklist for housing stock, climate factors, local tenure, water conditions research BEFORE content generation

5. **Content Generation Workflow (Per City):** Step-by-step process for setup, content generation (4 batches), quality verification, commit

6. **Script Templates (Reusable Across Cities):** YAML escaping rules, script patterns, duplication instructions for new cities

7. **Common Gotchas:** 6 critical issues discovered during Guelph batch:
   - Em dashes (--) in skill output - requires explicit instruction and grep verification
   - YAML single quote escaping (double single quotes: `City''s` not `City\'s`)
   - Grep false positives (frontmatter delimiters match em dash regex)
   - Service directory name mismatches (require manual mapping in scripts)
   - Context overload (LIGHT CONTEXT approach for boldness)
   - Build failures from invalid YAML (test scripts on 1-2 files first)

8. **Validation Checklist:** Complete quality gates for content, technical, rendering, and uniqueness verification

9. **Efficiency Metrics:** Time investment breakdown per story (US-001 through US-009) with expected gains for remaining 24 cities

10. **Remaining Work:** 528 service-city pages (24 cities), recommended region-based batching strategy, parallel execution notes

**Key Patterns Documented:**

**Skill Pipeline (MANDATORY):**
```
/orchestrator → /keyword-research → /positioning-angles → /brand-voice → /seo-content → /direct-response-copy
```

**Quality Gates (MANDATORY):**
