## Strategic Recommendations

### Tier 1: Publish First (Weeks 1-4) - Core Commercial Intent

1. **Furnace Installation Guelph** - Highest volume, core service, seasonal urgency
2. **Heat Pump Installation Guelph** - Strategic growth, rebate momentum, environmental positioning
3. **Air Conditioner Installation Guelph** - High volume, seasonal demand, core service
4. **Furnace Repair Guelph** - Emergency volume, leads to installations, year-round demand

**Why:** These 4 services drive the most qualified leads and have highest commercial intent. Establish dominance here first.

---

### Tier 2: Publish Second (Weeks 5-8) - High Priority Services

5. **Heat Pump Repair Guelph** - Growing installed base, service opportunity
6. **Air Conditioner Repair Guelph** - Seasonal emergency volume, installation pipeline
7. **Ductless Mini Split Installation Guelph** - Quick win, heritage home opportunity, less competitive
8. **Tankless Water Heater Installation Guelph** - Environmental appeal, growing awareness, rental market
9. **HVAC Maintenance Guelph** - Recurring revenue, customer retention

**Why:** Strong commercial intent with slightly lower volume or emerging markets. Build authority across service mix.

---

### Tier 3: Publish Third (Weeks 9-12) - Niche & Complementary

10. **Boiler Installation Guelph** - Heritage home niche, less competition
11. **Tank Water Heater Installation Guelph** - Emergency demand, steady volume

---

### Tier 4: Backlog (Consolidate with Other Services)

15-22. All "Replacement" services (Furnace, Heat Pump, AC, Boiler, Mini Split, Water Heater Replacement)
- **Strategy:** These keywords are captured by "Installation" pages. Include replacement messaging within installation pages rather than separate pages.
- Duct Cleaning - Add as supporting content to maintenance or IAQ pages

**Why:** Lower search volume, overlaps with installation content, avoid keyword cannibalization.
