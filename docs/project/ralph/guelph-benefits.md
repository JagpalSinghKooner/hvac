## Quality Control Checklist

Before using these benefits, verify:

✅ **City-specificity:** Each benefit references Guelph (location, climate, housing, water conditions, local tenure)
✅ **Concrete outcomes:** Titles state tangible results (warranty terms, response times, what customer gets)
✅ **NO em dashes:** All punctuation uses periods, commas, semicolons only
✅ **NO generic trust language:** Avoided "peace of mind," "worry-free," etc.
✅ **Accountability focus:** Benefits emphasize what B.A.P guarantees or handles
✅ **Brand voice maintained:** Expertise-based educator, specific over vague, honest about what customer receives

## Implementation Notes

- Each service has 3-4 benefits (mix of warranty, response time, local expertise, technical competency)
- Icons distributed: shield (warranty), clock (response time), home (local climate/housing), check-circle (process handled), award (certification/quality), star (expertise), wrench (service quality), phone (not used - prefer clock for response)
- Benefits complement (not duplicate) solution sections from US-007
- Emphasis on tangible, verifiable outcomes over emotional appeals
- Pattern: WHAT customer gets + WHY it matters or HOW it works

## Reusability for Remaining 24 Cities

This structure is reusable with city-specific adaptations:
- Replace Guelph-specific factors (Speed River → local geography, heritage homes → local housing stock, 30 years → tenure in market)
- Adjust climate references (cold winters → local climate challenges, humidity → local weather patterns)
- Maintain warranty terms, response time promises, and accountability focus (universal B.A.P differentiators)
- Keep icon distribution pattern (balance warranty, response, expertise, process benefits)
