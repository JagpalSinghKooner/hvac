## Furnace Installation

**Headline:** Right-Sized Furnace Systems, Installed to Manufacturer Specifications

**Description:** We start with a proper heat loss calculation for your Guelph home, accounting for insulation levels, window types, and local climate factors. This ensures your new furnace is sized correctly, not guessed based on square footage like many contractors do. Our TSSA-certified installers follow manufacturer specifications exactly, protecting your warranty and ensuring efficient operation. You get a furnace that heats evenly, runs efficiently, and lasts the full expected lifespan.

## Air Conditioner Installation

**Headline:** Properly Sized AC That Cools AND Dehumidifies Guelph Homes

**Description:** We perform cooling load calculations specific to your home's orientation, insulation, and Guelph's humid summer conditions. An oversized AC cools quickly but never runs long enough to remove humidity, leaving your home clammy. We size units to handle both temperature and moisture removal. Our installations include proper refrigerant charge verification and airflow testing. You get comfortable indoor conditions, not just cold air.

---

## Air Conditioner Repair

**Headline:** AC Diagnostics That Find Root Causes, Not Symptoms

**Description:** We diagnose why your AC failed, not just what stopped working. Low refrigerant means a leak somewhere; we find and fix it rather than topping up the charge and sending you a bill next season. Our experience with Guelph's climate patterns helps identify whether problems stem from equipment age, improper sizing, or maintenance neglect. You get honest guidance on repair economics vs. replacement timing.

## Boiler Installation

**Headline:** Boiler Systems Designed for Guelph's Heritage and Modern Homes

**Description:** Guelph's mix of heritage limestone homes and modern builds requires different boiler approaches. We match boiler capacity and distribution systems to your home's heating method, whether cast-iron radiators or modern radiant floors. Our installations respect heritage home constraints while delivering modern efficiency and control. TSSA-certified installation ensures safety compliance and warranty protection. You get reliable heat distribution designed for how your specific home was built.

---

## Boiler Repair

**Headline:** Boiler Repair Experience Across Guelph's Diverse Housing Stock

**Description:** Heritage home boilers present different challenges than modern systems, from managing cast-iron radiator distribution to working around original home features. We service boilers across Guelph's entire housing spectrum and understand the repair complexities each era presents. Our diagnostics identify whether problems stem from the boiler itself or distribution system issues. You get repairs that address actual failures, not guesswork that wastes money.

---

## Ductless Mini-Split

**Headline:** Ductless Solutions for Heritage Homes Without Compromising Character

**Description:** Guelph's downtown limestone homes and century properties often lack ductwork, making traditional central systems impractical or invasive. We design ductless mini-split placements that deliver even heating and cooling without visible equipment dominating your historic interiors. Our installations work within heritage preservation guidelines while providing modern comfort control. You get climate control that respects your home's character, not installations that require tearing out original walls.

---

## Tank Water Heaters

**Headline:** Water Heater Sizing Based on Your Household's Actual Usage

**Description:** We size tank water heaters based on your household's peak demand, not generic square footage estimates. Guelph's cold groundwater temperatures affect recovery time, which we factor into capacity recommendations. Our installations include proper venting, sediment management access, and code-compliant safety features. You get hot water capacity that matches your family's needs without paying for excess tank size you never use.

---

## Tankless Water Heaters

**Headline:** Tankless Systems Sized for Guelph's Cold Groundwater Temperatures

**Description:** Guelph's groundwater enters homes at 4-8°C in winter, requiring higher BTU capacity than mild climate regions. We size tankless units for worst-case temperature rise scenarios, ensuring adequate hot water flow even in January. Our installations include proper gas line sizing and venting for full-capacity operation. You get endless hot water that actually delivers on the tankless promise, not units that struggle in winter.

---

## Humidifiers

**Headline:** Whole-Home Humidification Calibrated for Guelph's Heating Season

**Description:** Guelph's cold winters drop indoor humidity to uncomfortable levels once heating systems run continuously. We size whole-home humidifiers to match your home's air exchange rate and heating system capacity. Installation includes proper drainage, maintenance access, and humidistat placement for accurate control. You get consistent humidity levels throughout winter without over-humidifying and causing condensation problems.

---

## Dehumidifiers

**Headline:** Whole-Home Dehumidification for Guelph's Humid Summer Conditions

**Description:** River valley proximity and humid Southern Ontario summers create moisture challenges in Guelph basements and living spaces. We install whole-home dehumidifiers integrated with your HVAC system, not portable units that need constant emptying. Our systems automatically remove excess moisture before it creates mold or comfort problems. You get controlled humidity year-round without managing multiple basement units.

---

## Air Filtration & Air Purifiers

**Headline:** Air Quality Systems Matched to Guelph's Seasonal Challenges

**Description:** Guelph faces spring pollen, summer humidity, and winter dry air issues that affect indoor air quality differently across seasons. We recommend filtration and purification systems based on your specific concerns, whether allergies, asthma, or general air quality improvement. Our installations integrate with existing HVAC systems for whole-home coverage. You get cleaner air throughout your home, not just in rooms with portable units.

---

## HRV/ERV Ventilation

**Headline:** Ventilation Systems That Recover Heat While Exchanging Stale Air

**Description:** Modern Guelph homes built to newer energy standards trap indoor air, requiring mechanical ventilation for air quality. We install heat recovery or energy recovery ventilators that bring fresh outdoor air in while recovering heating or cooling energy from exhaust air. System sizing accounts for your home's occupancy and square footage. You get fresh air continuously without the energy penalty of opening windows in Guelph's temperature extremes.

---

## Maintenance Plans

**Headline:** Scheduled HVAC Maintenance Based on What Actually Extends Equipment Life

**Description:** Our maintenance plans focus on service procedures that prevent premature failure, not unnecessary upselling. Thirty years servicing equipment in Guelph's climate shows which maintenance tasks matter and which don't. We schedule service before heating and cooling seasons when breakdowns are most disruptive and contractors hardest to book. You get equipment longevity without paying for make-work services designed to generate revenue.
