## Keyword Research Methodology

### How Keywords Were Generated

**6 Circles Expansion Method:**

1. **Circle 1 (What B.A.P Sells):** Direct service terms from 22 services × installation/repair/maintenance
2. **Circle 2 (Problems Solved):** Pain points affluent homeowners face (high bills, unreliable contractors, comfort issues)
3. **Circle 3 (Outcomes Delivered):** Results (energy savings, peace of mind, comfort, health)
4. **Circle 4 (B.A.P's Positioning):** Accountability, transparency, premium installation (NOT emergency/urgency)
5. **Circle 5 (Adjacent Topics):** Home renovation, energy efficiency, Canadian climate, affluent homeowner lifestyle
6. **Circle 6 (Entities):** HRAI, TSSA, government rebate programs, brand names, regional entities

**Expansion Techniques:**
- Question patterns (what is, how to, why, best, vs)
- Modifier patterns (tools, guide, cost, 2026, for beginners)
- Comparison patterns (X vs Y, best [category], alternatives)
- Location patterns (service + city, category + city, service + region)

### Search Volume Estimation (Conservative)

Without paid tools, search volume estimates are based on:
- Google autocomplete suggestions (high volume = appears in autocomplete)
- Google Trends (relative trend direction, seasonal patterns)
- "People Also Ask" boxes (high volume = more PAA questions)
- Competitor page count (high competition = high volume)
- Manual SERP analysis (ad density = commercial intent + volume)

**Estimate tiers:**
- **High volume:** 3,000+ monthly (heat pump installation Ontario, furnace installation, HVAC contractor [city])
- **Medium volume:** 1,000-3,000 monthly (boiler installation, indoor air quality, specific city combinations)
- **Low volume:** <1,000 monthly (niche terms, very specific long-tail)

### Competition Assessment

**Manual SERP checks recommended for priority keywords:**

1. **Search the keyword in Google**
2. **Analyze top 3 results:**
   - Local contractors?
   - National directories (HomeStars, HomeAdvisor)?
   - Government sites?
   - Content farms?
   - Domain authority (check with MozBar or similar free tool)

3. **Content quality assessment:**
   - Thin content (<1,000 words) = opportunity
   - Generic templated content = opportunity
   - Outdated (2+ years old) = opportunity
   - Comprehensive guides (5,000+ words) = high competition

4. **Opportunity scoring:**
   - **High opportunity:** No local contractor in top 3, thin/outdated content, directories dominate
   - **Medium opportunity:** Mix of contractors and directories, moderate content quality
   - **Low opportunity:** Established authority sites dominate, excellent comprehensive content exists

### Free Tools for Validation

**Google Search Console** (after content published):
- Track impressions, clicks, average position
- Identify ranking keywords
- Find "near miss" keywords (positions 11-20) to optimize

**Google Trends:**
- Trend direction (growing, stable, declining)
- Seasonal patterns (AC spikes in spring/summer)
- Regional interest (confirm Southern Ontario searches)

**Google Search:**
- Autocomplete suggestions
- "People Also Ask" related questions
- "Searches related to" at bottom of SERP
- SERP features (featured snippets, local pack, ads)
