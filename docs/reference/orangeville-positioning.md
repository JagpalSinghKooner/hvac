**City Context:** Dufferin County, growing town (30,000 pop), Credit Valley, expanding residential areas, mix of new builds and heritage homes
**Target Customer:** Affluent homeowners in growing community, $10K-$15K+ HVAC investments, research-mode buyers
**Against:** Emergency/urgency competitors with 24/7 messaging

## Winning Angle: "Modern Systems, Heritage Care"

**The Positioning:**
Orangeville is growing, but it's not losing its character. New subdivisions expand alongside century homes downtown. That means one-size-fits-all HVAC doesn't work here. B.A.P brings 32 years of experience matching modern high-efficiency systems to both new construction (where builders rush) and heritage properties (where preservation matters). Whether you're protecting original plaster and trim during a retrofit or ensuring your new build's system actually delivers what the spec sheet promised, you need an installer who respects both the building and the investment.

**Why It Works:**
Affluent homeowners in growing communities face a unique challenge: contractors rushing to keep up with expansion. New builds get cookie-cutter installations that don't account for Credit Valley microclimates or future home additions. Heritage home owners get scared off by contractors who don't understand discrete installation in century properties. This angle positions B.A.P as the careful, experienced choice—neither rushing through new construction nor damaging heritage features. It's exactly what research-mode buyers in Orangeville want: someone who takes time to do it right.
