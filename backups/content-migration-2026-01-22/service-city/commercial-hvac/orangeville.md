  Orangeville's position as the commercial hub of Dufferin County creates diverse HVAC demands across its growing business community. Broadway's historic downtown features restaurants, professional services, and retail shops in character buildings requiring climate systems that respect architectural heritage while providing modern comfort. The industrial areas along Centennial Road and Highway 10 house manufacturing operations, food processing facilities, and distribution centres with substantial ventilation and climate control needs. The commercial corridors serve the agricultural community and growing residential population with retail plazas, medical facilities, and service businesses. Orangeville's role as a regional centre means businesses must maintain comfortable environments for customers traveling from throughout the surrounding countryside.
