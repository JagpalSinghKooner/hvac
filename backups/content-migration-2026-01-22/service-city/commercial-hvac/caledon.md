localContext: |
  Caledon's vast geography and mixed commercial landscape create unique HVAC challenges across this sprawling municipality. The Bolton commercial area serves as the primary business centre with retail plazas, professional offices, and restaurants requiring reliable year-round climate control. Highway 50 and Mayfield Road corridors house industrial operations, logistics facilities, and commercial developments with substantial heating and cooling demands. The equestrian and agricultural businesses throughout Caledon require specialized climate systems for horse barns, greenhouses, and farm operations. Caledon Village and other smaller communities feature local businesses serving residents and visitors to the Niagara Escarpment, all requiring dependable HVAC service despite the rural distances involved.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our equestrian facility needed precise climate control for our indoor arena and stable areas. B.A.P designed a system that handles the unique ventilation requirements and keeps our horses comfortable year-round."
