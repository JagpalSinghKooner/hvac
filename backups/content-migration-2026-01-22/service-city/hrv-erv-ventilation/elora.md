localContext: |
  Elora's status as one of Ontario's most beautiful heritage villages creates unique ventilation challenges in homes where preserving architectural character while achieving modern comfort is essential. The limestone and brick buildings throughout the village core, many dating to the 1850s, increasingly undergo careful energy retrofits that improve insulation and air sealing while respecting heritage features. These improvements dramatically reduce natural air infiltration, requiring mechanical ventilation to maintain healthy indoor air quality and protect historic materials from moisture damage. Properties overlooking the Elora Gorge and Grand River experience elevated humidity during summer months, making ERV systems valuable for moisture management in seasonal applications. Newer homes on Elora's edges meet current building code requirements for airtight construction and continuous ventilation. Artists, craftspeople, and professionals who choose Elora for its beauty and tranquility particularly value fresh air quality and energy efficiency, making HRV systems ideal for the village's environmentally conscious community.

  testimonial: "Our 1860s stone home in Elora village was prone to moisture and stuffy air after we improved the insulation. B.A.P installed an HRV system that solved both problems beautifully. Fresh air flows constantly, the stone stays dry, and our heating bills remained manageable."
