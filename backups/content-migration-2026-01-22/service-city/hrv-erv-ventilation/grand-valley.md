localContext: |
  Grand Valley's rural character and position along the upper Grand River attract homeowners seeking country living with modern amenities, including energy-efficient homes requiring proper mechanical ventilation. The community features a mix of heritage village properties and newer custom-built homes on larger lots, each presenting distinct ventilation requirements. Custom rural homes throughout Grand Valley are typically constructed to high energy standards with superior insulation and air barriers that virtually eliminate natural air infiltration, making HRV systems essential for healthy indoor air quality. Older properties in the village core undergoing energy retrofits experience the same transformation from naturally ventilated to airtight construction, requiring mechanical fresh air supply. Grand Valley's elevation and inland location create cold winter conditions where heat recovery provides significant energy savings. Homeowners who chose Grand Valley for its peaceful rural atmosphere particularly appreciate ventilation systems that bring in clean country air while filtering allergens and recovering indoor heat energy throughout the long heating season.
