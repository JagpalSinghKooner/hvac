localContext: |
  Burlington's lakefront location and prosperous residential communities create specific ventilation requirements that vary significantly across the city. Homes along Lake Ontario in areas like Roseland, Shoreacres, and LaSalle Park experience elevated humidity from lake effect moisture, making ERV systems particularly beneficial for controlling indoor humidity levels during summer months. The established neighbourhoods of Aldershot and Mountainside feature well-maintained older homes increasingly undergoing energy efficiency upgrades that improve air sealing dramatically, necessitating mechanical ventilation to maintain indoor air quality. New construction in Millcroft, Orchard, and the Appleby area meets current Ontario Building Code requirements for airtight construction, with HRV or ERV systems essential for providing continuous fresh air without energy waste. Burlington's temperate microclimate from its protected position between the lake and the escarpment creates unique conditions our technicians consider when sizing and selecting the optimal ventilation solution for each home's specific needs.
