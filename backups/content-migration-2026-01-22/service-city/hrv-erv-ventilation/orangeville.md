localContext: |
  Orangeville's position at the headwaters of the Credit River and its elevation on the Niagara Escarpment create distinct climate conditions that influence ventilation system selection for local homes. The town experiences colder winters than lower elevation communities, making heat recovery particularly valuable for energy efficiency and comfort. Historic properties in the Downtown Broadway heritage district and older neighbourhoods increasingly undergo energy retrofits that dramatically improve air sealing, requiring mechanical ventilation to maintain healthy indoor air quality without excessive energy loss. Newer subdivisions in areas like Hansen, Montgomery Village, and Dawson Road are constructed to modern Ontario Building Code standards requiring continuous ventilation systems. Orangeville's small-town character attracts families seeking cleaner air than urban centres, and these homeowners often prioritize ventilation systems that filter incoming fresh air while recovering indoor heat energy. Our installations throughout Orangeville address the community's specific needs for efficient winter ventilation in this elevated headwaters location.
