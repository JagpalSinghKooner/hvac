seoDescription: 'HRV and ERV ventilation installation in Shelburne, ON. Fresh air with heat recovery. Serving Shelburne since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Shelburne's position at the headwaters region on the edge of the Niagara Escarpment means colder winters and greater temperature extremes than communities at lower elevations, making heat recovery ventilation particularly valuable for energy efficiency. The town has experienced steady growth with new subdivisions built to modern energy codes requiring continuous mechanical ventilation in airtight homes. Established properties throughout Shelburne's historic core increasingly undergo energy improvements that seal drafts and add insulation, creating the need for controlled fresh air supply through HRV systems. Families attracted to Shelburne's small-town atmosphere and more affordable housing prioritize indoor air quality, especially during extended winter months when homes remain sealed against the cold. The town's elevation means longer heating seasons where HRV systems provide significant energy savings by recovering heat from exhaust air before it leaves the building. Our Shelburne installations are designed to handle the community's challenging winter conditions while maintaining healthy indoor air quality year-round.

  testimonial: "Shelburne winters are cold and long. After insulating our older home, we needed a way to get fresh air without opening windows in January. B.A.P installed an HRV that keeps our air fresh while recovering almost all the heat. A perfect solution for our climate."
