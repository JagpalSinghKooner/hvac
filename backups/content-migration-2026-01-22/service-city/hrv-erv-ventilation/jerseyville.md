localContext: |
  Jerseyville's rural community in the heart of Flamborough offers peaceful country living where custom-built homes are designed to high energy efficiency standards requiring mechanical ventilation. Properties throughout the Jerseyville area typically feature superior insulation and air barriers that create exceptionally tight building envelopes, eliminating natural air infiltration that older homes relied upon for fresh air. These airtight homes require HRV or ERV systems to provide controlled fresh air supply without wasting conditioned air through open windows or inefficient exhaust fans. The agricultural surroundings mean seasonal dust and pollen that benefit from filtered fresh air supply, protecting indoor air quality while bringing in clean outdoor air. Jerseyville's position away from urban centres creates cold winter conditions where heat recovery becomes essential for maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures efficiently. Homeowners who chose Jerseyville for rural tranquility appreciate ventilation systems that provide fresh country air while recovering the heat energy their furnaces work hard to produce.
