seoDescription: 'HRV and ERV ventilation installation in Bolton, ON. Fresh air with heat recovery. Serving Bolton since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Bolton serves as Caledon's largest community and has experienced significant residential growth with new subdivisions built to modern energy efficiency standards requiring mechanical ventilation. Developments in areas like South Hill, North Hill, and the expanding edges of Bolton feature tightly constructed homes where HRV or ERV systems are essential for providing fresh air without wasting conditioned air through open windows or exhaust-only fans. The established core of Bolton contains older homes increasingly undergoing energy retrofits that improve insulation and air sealing, creating the same ventilation requirements as new construction. Bolton's elevation on the Humber River watershed and its distance from Lake Ontario moderation create cold winter conditions where heat recovery becomes particularly valuable for energy efficiency. Young families drawn to Bolton for its community atmosphere and proximity to both rural amenities and GTA employment prioritize indoor air quality for their children, making whole-home ventilation systems increasingly popular throughout the community.

  testimonial: "After upgrading our 1980s Bolton home with spray foam insulation, we noticed stale air and moisture on windows. B.A.P recommended an HRV sized for our house. The difference is remarkable, fresh air constantly flowing and our windows stay clear even on the coldest days."
