localContext: |
  Acton's position in the rolling hills of Halton Hills creates a charming small-town atmosphere with distinctive ventilation requirements shaped by the community's mix of heritage homes and newer construction. The historic downtown core features older buildings increasingly undergoing energy retrofits that dramatically improve air sealing, requiring mechanical ventilation to maintain healthy indoor air quality after eliminating traditional drafts. Newer developments on Acton's edges meet current Ontario Building Code requirements for airtight construction and continuous fresh air supply through HRV or ERV systems. Acton's inland location and elevation mean colder winters than lakeside communities, making heat recovery particularly valuable for energy efficiency during the extended heating season. The town's leather-making heritage means some older industrial buildings converted to residential use present unique ventilation challenges our technicians understand. Families drawn to Acton's small-town character prioritize healthy indoor environments, especially during cold months when homes remain sealed against the elements.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We bought an older home in Acton and did a major energy retrofit. After sealing everything properly, the air quality suffered until B.A.P installed an HRV system. Now we have the best of both worlds: an efficient home with fresh, clean air constantly circulating."
