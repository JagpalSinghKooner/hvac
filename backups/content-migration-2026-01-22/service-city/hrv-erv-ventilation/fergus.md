localContext: |
  Fergus combines Scottish heritage charm with modern residential growth, creating diverse ventilation requirements across its historic core and newer subdivisions. The beautiful limestone buildings and heritage homes along the Grand River in downtown Fergus increasingly undergo energy improvements that seal traditional drafts, requiring mechanical ventilation to maintain healthy indoor air quality. New developments in areas like the Belsyde Avenue corridor and east Fergus are constructed to current Ontario Building Code standards requiring continuous ventilation systems for airtight homes. Fergus experiences Wellington County's cold winters where heat recovery becomes essential for energy-efficient fresh air supply, with HRV systems recovering up to 80% of heat that would be lost through traditional exhaust ventilation. The town's growing population includes young families and retirees who prioritize indoor air quality, particularly during extended winter months when homes remain closed up. Our Fergus installations address both code compliance requirements and homeowner expectations for comfortable, healthy indoor environments.

  testimonial: "Our stone heritage home in downtown Fergus was beautifully restored but became stuffy after we sealed all the drafts. B.A.P installed an HRV system that provides fresh air without destroying our heating efficiency. The stonework stays protected from moisture issues too."
