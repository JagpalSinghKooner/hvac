localContext: |
  Rockwood's village charm and proximity to the Rockwood Conservation Area attract environmentally conscious homeowners who value both natural surroundings and energy-efficient homes with excellent indoor air quality. The village features a distinctive mix of historic limestone buildings, established mid-century homes, and newer properties, each with specific ventilation requirements. Heritage buildings in the village core undergoing energy retrofits need mechanical ventilation to maintain air quality after sealing traditional air leakage paths that provided natural but inefficient air exchange. Newer homes meet current Ontario Building Code requirements for airtight construction and continuous fresh air systems. Rockwood's position along the Eramosa River creates localized humidity patterns that influence whether HRV or ERV systems provide optimal performance for specific applications. Nature enthusiasts who choose Rockwood for its conservation lands and hiking trails particularly value filtered fresh air systems that remove outdoor allergens while recovering indoor heat energy during cold months.

  testimonial: "Our renovated limestone home in Rockwood village was beautiful but stuffy after we improved the insulation. B.A.P installed an HRV system that provides constant fresh air without wasting heat. Our historic home now has modern air quality while keeping heating costs controlled."
