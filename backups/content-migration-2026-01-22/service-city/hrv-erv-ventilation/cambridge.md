seoDescription: 'HRV and ERV ventilation installation in Cambridge, ON. Fresh air with heat recovery. Serving Cambridge since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Cambridge's three historic communities of Galt, Preston, and Hespeler each present distinct ventilation challenges that our technicians address daily. The grand Victorian homes along the Grand River in Galt often undergo deep energy retrofits that dramatically improve air sealing, creating an immediate need for mechanical ventilation to maintain healthy indoor air quality. Preston's post-war housing stock and Hespeler's mill-era workers' cottages frequently trap moisture and cooking odours after weatherization upgrades. New subdivisions in the Conestoga College area and Blair Road corridor are built to modern energy codes requiring continuous ventilation systems. Cambridge's position at the confluence of the Grand and Speed Rivers creates elevated humidity levels that make ERV systems particularly valuable for managing indoor moisture during summer months. Our installations comply with all Ontario Building Code ventilation requirements while helping Cambridge homeowners achieve significant energy savings by recovering heat that traditional exhaust systems would waste.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our renovated century home in Galt had terrible air quality after we upgraded the insulation. Windows were constantly foggy and it smelled musty. The HRV system B.A.P installed solved everything. The air is fresh and clean, and we are not losing heat like before."
