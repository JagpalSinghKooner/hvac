localContext: |
  Milton has experienced explosive growth over the past two decades, with new subdivisions built to increasingly stringent energy efficiency codes that require mechanical ventilation for healthy indoor air. Communities like Willmott, Harrison, Ford, and Scott feature homes constructed with advanced air barriers and continuous insulation that virtually eliminate natural air infiltration, making HRV or ERV systems essential rather than optional. Young families who comprise much of Milton's population are particularly concerned about indoor air quality for their children, driving demand for ventilation systems that remove allergens, VOCs, and excess humidity while supplying filtered fresh air continuously. The established Old Milton neighbourhood and Escarpment areas have many older homes undergoing renovation and energy upgrades that create the same ventilation requirements as new construction. Milton's position at the base of the Niagara Escarpment creates variable humidity conditions that our technicians consider when recommending HRV versus ERV systems for each specific application.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We moved into our new build in Harrison and immediately noticed stuffy air and window condensation. The builder said it was normal for new homes. B.A.P installed an HRV system that made an incredible difference. Fresh air, no condensation, and better sleep for our whole family."
