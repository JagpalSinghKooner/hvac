localContext: |
  Breslau has transformed from a quiet farming community into a rapidly growing residential area where modern energy-efficient construction is standard. New subdivisions throughout Breslau feature homes built to current Ontario Building Code requirements with tight building envelopes that virtually eliminate natural air infiltration, making mechanical ventilation systems essential for healthy indoor air. The community's position between Kitchener and Cambridge attracts young families who prioritize indoor air quality for their children, particularly in homes where cooking odours, humidity, and indoor pollutants accumulate without proper ventilation. Breslau's flat terrain and agricultural surroundings mean homes face seasonal challenges including spring pollen and harvest dust that benefit from filtered fresh air systems. Older farmhouses and rural properties in the area undergoing energy retrofits experience the same transition to airtight construction, requiring HRV systems to maintain air quality while preserving heating efficiency. Our Breslau installations ensure both new construction compliance and comfortable indoor environments in this growing community.

  testimonial: "Our new build in Breslau had all the windows fogging up in winter and the air felt stale. The builder said it was normal for energy-efficient homes. B.A.P installed an HRV that solved both problems completely. Fresh air and clear windows all winter long."
