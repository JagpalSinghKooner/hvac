localContext: |
  Fergus is known for its stunning Scottish heritage architecture and the beautiful Grand River that flows through town. However, the stone and brick construction that gives Fergus its character does not prevent the dry air problems that accompany Ontario winters. The town's elevation in Wellington County means temperatures that can be several degrees colder than urban areas, pushing heating systems harder and depleting indoor humidity further. Historic limestone homes in the downtown core require careful humidity management to prevent damage to original plaster, woodwork, and masonry. Newer developments in Fergus also struggle with dry air as modern tight construction holds in whatever humidity level exists, whether too high or too low. The Grand River provides scenic beauty but not indoor moisture relief. A whole-home humidifier ensures your Fergus home stays comfortable and protected all winter.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our limestone home in downtown Fergus is over 150 years old. The dry air was causing the original plaster to crack and the wood floors to separate. B.A.P installed a steam humidifier that keeps everything stable. The house has never been this comfortable in winter."
