localContext: |
  Shelburne sits at one of the highest elevations in Southern Ontario, which translates to some of the coldest winter temperatures in the region. This northern Dufferin County town experiences extended heating seasons that push furnaces to their limits and strip indoor air of essential moisture. The growing community has seen significant development, with new homes joining established properties throughout town. Both old and new construction face the same challenge: maintaining healthy humidity levels when outdoor temperatures plunge. Shelburne families report that dry winter air contributes to increased illness, disrupted sleep, and persistent discomfort. The town's location means residents cannot escape the effects of dry air by driving south for winter. Investing in a whole-home humidifier makes your Shelburne home a comfortable retreat from the harsh conditions outside.
