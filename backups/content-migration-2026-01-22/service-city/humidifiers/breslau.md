localContext: |
  Breslau has transformed from a quiet village into a thriving community with significant new residential development. Young families attracted by the location between Kitchener and Guelph are discovering that their modern, energy-efficient homes come with an unexpected challenge: severely dry winter air. Contemporary construction techniques that make homes well-insulated and energy-efficient also make them prone to humidity problems, as tight building envelopes trap whatever conditions exist inside. New Breslau homeowners report static electricity, dry skin, and respiratory issues during their first winters. The community's newer homes feature open floor plans and modern finishes that show every effect of low humidity, from gaps in laminate flooring to cracked drywall joints. A whole-home humidifier installation solves these problems permanently, integrating with your modern HVAC system to maintain optimal moisture levels automatically.

  testimonial: "We built new in Breslau and were shocked at how dry the house was our first winter. The laminate was gapping, we were getting shocked constantly. B.A.P added a bypass humidifier and it is a completely different home now. Essential for any new build."
