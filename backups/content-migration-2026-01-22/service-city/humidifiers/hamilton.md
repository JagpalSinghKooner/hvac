localContext: |
  Hamilton's diverse neighbourhoods, from the historic homes on the Mountain to the revitalized properties in the North End and Westdale, all share one winter challenge: desperately dry indoor air. The Escarpment may provide stunning views, but it does nothing to prevent the moisture-stripping effects of Ontario winters on your home. Century homes in Durand and Kirkendall are particularly vulnerable, with original hardwood floors, crown mouldings, and wooden windows at risk of permanent damage from humidity below 25%. Steel City families report that dry air worsens asthma, eczema, and seasonal allergies that are already aggravated by local air quality concerns. A professionally installed whole-home humidifier maintains healthy indoor humidity, protecting both your property value and your family's respiratory health throughout Hamilton's long heating season.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our century home in Durand was losing trim pieces every winter from the dry air. B.A.P installed a steam humidifier that keeps humidity steady no matter how cold it gets outside. The historic woodwork is finally stable."
