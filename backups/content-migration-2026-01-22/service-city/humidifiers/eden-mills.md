localContext: |
  Eden Mills may be one of Ontario's smallest villages, but its residents face the same oversized dry air challenges as larger communities. This tight-knit hamlet along the Eramosa River is known for environmental consciousness and literary culture, with residents who value healthy, sustainable living. The village's heritage homes and converted mill buildings require careful humidity management to preserve their historic character and protect the books, art, and instruments many residents treasure. Eden Mills' location in the rolling countryside means exposure to cold winds and long heating seasons that deplete indoor moisture. The community's commitment to environmental stewardship aligns perfectly with whole-home humidification, which improves comfort while reducing heating costs by making properly humidified air feel warmer at lower thermostat settings. A whole-home humidifier is the thoughtful choice for Eden Mills homeowners.
