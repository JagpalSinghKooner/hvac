localContext: |
  Guelph's historic downtown and established neighborhoods like the Ward, St. Patrick's Ward, and Exhibition Park feature many older homes with hydronic boiler heating systems. These century-old limestone and brick houses rely on well-maintained boilers to handle Guelph's cold winters, where temperatures regularly drop below minus fifteen degrees Celsius. The city's commitment to environmental sustainability through initiatives like the Community Energy Plan means many Guelph homeowners prioritize efficient heating systems. University of Guelph faculty housing and the mature residential areas near the Speed River contain numerous homes where annual boiler maintenance is essential for reliable winter comfort and energy efficiency.
