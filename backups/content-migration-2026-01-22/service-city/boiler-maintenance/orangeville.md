localContext: |
  Orangeville's position at the headwaters of the Credit River and its elevation on the hills of Dufferin County means residents experience some of the coldest winter temperatures in the region. The historic downtown and established neighborhoods along Broadway and First Street contain many heritage homes where boiler heating has been the trusted choice for decades. Orangeville winters bring heavy snowfall and extended periods where temperatures remain well below freezing, placing significant demands on heating systems. The town's character homes and rural properties in the surrounding countryside often feature hydronic heating systems that provide the consistent, comfortable warmth these cold-climate homes require. Annual boiler maintenance is essential for Orangeville homeowners facing these challenging winter conditions.
