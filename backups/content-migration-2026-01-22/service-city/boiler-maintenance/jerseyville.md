localContext: |
  Jerseyville is a small rural community in the Township of Ancaster surrounded by farmland and country properties where traditional heating systems remain common. The hamlet and surrounding agricultural areas feature many century homes and farmhouses where boiler heating has provided reliable warmth for generations. Jerseyville's location between Hamilton and Brantford means residents experience Southern Ontario winters with cold temperatures and snowfall that demand dependable heating systems. The area's larger rural properties often feature boiler systems chosen for their ability to heat spacious farmhouses efficiently and reliably. Many Jerseyville homeowners appreciate the consistent, even warmth that hydronic heating provides, especially in older homes with thick walls and varied layouts. Annual boiler maintenance ensures these heritage heating systems continue performing safely through the demanding winter months.
