  Elmira is the largest community in Woolwich Township and serves as a commercial center for the surrounding Mennonite farming communities. The town's historic downtown along Arthur Street and established residential neighborhoods feature many older homes where boiler heating provides reliable winter warmth. Elmira experiences typical Waterloo Region winters with cold temperatures, significant snowfall, and extended freezing periods that demand dependable heating systems. The town's heritage homes and the surrounding agricultural properties often feature boiler systems chosen for their durability and ability to heat larger older homes efficiently. Many Elmira families have relied on hydronic heating for generations, appreciating the consistent, comfortable warmth that well-maintained boiler systems deliver during the coldest months of winter.
