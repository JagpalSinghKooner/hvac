localContext: |
  Shelburne sits at the intersection of Dufferin and Grey Counties, experiencing some of the region's coldest winter temperatures and most significant snowfall. The town's historic downtown along Main Street and established residential neighborhoods contain many older homes where boiler heating provides reliable warmth through challenging winters. Shelburne's elevation and distance from the moderating influence of the Great Lakes means residents face extended periods of sub-zero temperatures that test heating systems thoroughly. The surrounding agricultural lands feature many farmhouses with boiler systems chosen for their durability and ability to heat large, older homes efficiently. Annual boiler maintenance is particularly important for Shelburne homeowners, as mid-winter heating failures in this climate can quickly become emergencies requiring immediate attention.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Shelburne winters are among the coldest in the region. Our boiler has never failed us since B.A.P started maintaining it annually. That peace of mind is priceless when temperatures drop to minus twenty-five."
