localContext: |
  Erin is a charming village in Wellington County where rural character meets historic small-town Ontario. The village center and surrounding countryside feature many heritage homes and farmhouses where boiler heating systems have been trusted for generations. Erin's location on the Credit River and its elevation in the hills of Wellington County means residents experience colder winters with significant snowfall compared to areas closer to the Great Lakes. The town's stone farmhouses and Victorian-era village homes often feature original or updated hydronic heating systems that require knowledgeable maintenance. Erin homeowners value the consistent, comfortable heat that well-maintained boilers provide, especially important for the historic properties that characterize this picturesque community. Annual maintenance ensures reliable performance through Erin's challenging winter conditions.
