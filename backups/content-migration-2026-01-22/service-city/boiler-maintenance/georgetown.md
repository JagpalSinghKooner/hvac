localContext: |
  Georgetown is the largest community in Halton Hills and features a charming downtown core with well-preserved heritage buildings and established residential neighborhoods. The historic areas along Main Street and throughout the original town contain many older homes where boiler heating has been trusted for generations. Georgetown's position on the Niagara Escarpment means residents experience colder temperatures and more significant winter snowfall than communities closer to Lake Ontario. The town's mix of Victorian homes, early twentieth century residences, and modern developments includes many properties where hydronic heating provides superior winter comfort. Georgetown families appreciate the consistent, even warmth that well-maintained boiler systems deliver, especially during extended cold periods when temperatures remain below freezing for weeks at a time.
