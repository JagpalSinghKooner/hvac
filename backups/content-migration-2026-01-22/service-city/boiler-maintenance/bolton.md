localContext: |
  Bolton is the largest community within Caledon and features a blend of historic village character and growing suburban development. The original Bolton village core along Queen Street contains heritage homes where boiler heating has provided reliable warmth for generations. Bolton's location in the Humber River valley and its elevation on the moraine means residents experience cold winters with significant snowfall and extended freezing periods. The town's mix of established neighborhoods and newer developments includes many homes where homeowners have chosen hydronic heating for its comfort and efficiency. Bolton families appreciate the consistent, even warmth that well-maintained boiler systems provide, especially during the coldest winter months when forced-air systems often struggle to maintain comfortable temperatures throughout larger homes.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We chose a boiler system when we built our Bolton home for the radiant floor heating. B.A.P maintains it annually, and our floors are warm and comfortable all winter long."
