localContext: |
  Guelph homeowners rely on heat pumps year-round for efficient heating and cooling, but the city's variable climate can put significant stress on these systems. In neighborhoods like the Ward, South End, and Exhibition Park, we see common issues including defrost cycle failures during cold snaps, refrigerant leaks from thermal cycling, and compressor strain from the humid summers along the Speed River corridor. Many older homes in Downtown Guelph and the historic areas have been retrofitted with ductless mini-split heat pumps, which require specialized repair knowledge. The University of Guelph area sees high demand for emergency repairs during extreme weather when students and residents depend on reliable climate control. Our technicians understand the unique challenges of Guelph's housing stock, from century homes in the Old University to newer builds in the south end, ensuring your heat pump receives expert diagnosis and lasting repairs.
