seoDescription: 'Expert heat pump repair in Brantford, ON. All brands serviced, same-day appointments. Serving Brantford since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Brantford homeowners across the Grand River valley depend on heat pumps for efficient year-round comfort, and B.A.P provides the expert repair services these systems require. In established neighborhoods like Eagle Place, West Brant, and Terrace Hill, we service both traditional air-source heat pumps and modern cold-climate models. The historic Downtown and Victoria Park areas feature many century homes retrofitted with ductless mini-split systems that require specialized repair knowledge. River proximity in areas like Holmedale affects humidity levels and can contribute to coil corrosion and defrost issues. Brantford's climate with hot summers and cold winters tests heat pump reversing valves and compressors throughout the year. We frequently address refrigerant leaks, defrost board failures, and thermostat communication problems across the city. The growing areas of west Brantford feature newer homes with integrated heat pump systems that still require regular service and occasional repair. Emergency response is essential when Brantford families lose heating or cooling.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our heat pump was running constantly but not keeping up with the cold. B.A.P found the refrigerant was low due to a small leak at a fitting. They repaired it properly and recharged the system. Much better performance now."
