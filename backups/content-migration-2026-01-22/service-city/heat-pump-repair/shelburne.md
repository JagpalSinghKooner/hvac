localContext: |
  Shelburne's position as the gateway to Dufferin County's highlands means heat pumps face demanding cold-weather operation that requires expert repair services. The town's established neighborhoods feature homes with both retrofitted ductless systems and newer integrated heat pump installations. Shelburne's higher elevation brings colder winters than southern communities, making cold-climate heat pumps increasingly popular and defrost system reliability critical. The growing residential areas east and west of Main Street have modern energy-efficient homes designed around heat pump technology. Rural properties in Melancthon and surrounding townships often have larger systems serving farmhouses and agricultural buildings. We frequently address issues with auxiliary heat not engaging, defrost failures during extended cold periods, and compressor strain from continuous winter operation. The Shelburne community depends on reliable heating through long winters, and B.A.P provides prompt emergency response throughout the area. Our technicians understand cold-climate heat pump requirements and arrive prepared to diagnose and repair quickly.

  testimonial: "Our heat pump auxiliary heat strips failed during a minus-25 cold snap. B.A.P came out despite the terrible weather and replaced them the same day. Could not have survived that cold without their help."
