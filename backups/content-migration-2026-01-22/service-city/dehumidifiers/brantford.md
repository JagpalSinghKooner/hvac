localContext: |
  Brantford's location along the Grand River creates natural humidity conditions that affect homes throughout the city. Historic neighbourhoods like West Brant, Holmedale, and Eagle Place feature housing stock dating back to the early 1900s with stone and block foundations that allow moisture infiltration. The river valley topography means humid air settles in lower-lying areas, while spring flooding events can leave elevated groundwater levels that persist for months. Brantford's industrial heritage means many worker housing areas were built quickly with minimal waterproofing, leaving subsequent homeowners to manage persistent basement dampness. The heavy clay soil throughout Brantford holds moisture against foundations and resists drainage. Newer developments in the north end were built on former agricultural land where altered drainage patterns create unexpected moisture problems. Many Brantford homeowners notice musty odors that cleaning cannot eliminate, condensation on basement windows even with the air conditioning running, and visible mold growth in corners and closets. These symptoms indicate humidity levels that damage your home and affect your family's health. Whole-home dehumidification provides the comprehensive moisture control Brantford properties need.
