localContext: |
  Milton has experienced explosive growth over the past two decades, with new subdivisions built on former farmland that often presents unexpected moisture challenges. The rapid development in areas like Bristol, Timberlea, and Harrison neighbourhoods occurred on land with established drainage patterns that were disrupted by construction, leading to groundwater issues that affect newer homes. Old Milton near downtown features heritage properties with stone foundations that are particularly susceptible to moisture infiltration during spring thaw and heavy rain events. The Niagara Escarpment's presence along Milton's western edge influences local humidity patterns and groundwater flow, with homes near the escarpment seeing higher moisture levels. Clay soil composition throughout Milton holds water against foundations, and many newer homes were built with basements intended as future living space but without the humidity control systems needed to keep them comfortable. Summer humidity in Milton regularly exceeds comfortable levels, making finished basements feel damp and promoting mold growth in storage areas. Whole-home dehumidification protects both older and newer Milton homes from moisture-related damage.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our new home in Harrison had basement humidity problems from day one. The builder said it was normal but we knew it was not right. B.A.P installed a whole-home dehumidifier and our basement finally feels like part of the house instead of a damp cellar."
