localContext: |
  Oakville's position on Lake Ontario means homeowners face elevated humidity levels throughout the warmer months. The prestigious Old Oakville neighbourhood features heritage homes with mature landscaping that can trap moisture around foundations, while newer developments in North Oakville were built on former agricultural land with disrupted drainage patterns. Bronte, with its harbour and creek, experiences particularly high ambient humidity that affects both historic waterfront properties and newer construction. The Sixteen Mile Creek valley creates a moisture corridor that influences homes in Glen Abbey and surrounding areas. Oakville's clay soil composition is notorious for holding water against foundations, and many homes built during the 1980s and 1990s development boom have basements that were finished without adequate moisture management. Homeowners with expensive finished basements, home theatres, and wine cellars need precise humidity control to protect their investments. High humidity also affects main floor comfort, making homes feel clammy even when the air conditioning is running. Whole-home dehumidification is essential for maintaining the comfort and protecting the value of Oakville properties.
