localContext: |
  Waterloo combines historic Uptown neighbourhoods with extensive newer development, and humidity challenges affect both. The student housing areas near University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University experience high humidity from occupancy levels that exceed original design assumptions, creating condensation problems and mold-friendly conditions. Established areas like Westmount and Lakeshore feature homes from the 1960s and 1970s with basements that were never intended to be living space but have since been finished without adequate moisture management. The clay-heavy soil composition in Waterloo retains moisture against foundations, particularly in low-lying areas near Laurel Creek. Columbia Lake and surrounding wetland areas contribute to elevated ambient humidity throughout summer months. Many Waterloo homeowners notice musty odors that seem impossible to eliminate, window condensation during humid weather, and mold growth in closets and basement corners. These symptoms indicate humidity levels that exceed the safe 30-50% range and require whole-home dehumidification to resolve. Protecting your Waterloo home from moisture damage starts with proper humidity control.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We bought a home in Lakeshore with a finished basement that always smelled musty. A mold inspection found growth behind the drywall. After remediation, B.A.P installed a whole-home dehumidifier to prevent recurrence. Two years later, still no issues."
