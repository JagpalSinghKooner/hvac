localContext: |
  Guelph's older neighbourhoods like the Ward, St. George's Park, and Exhibition Park feature many century homes with stone and rubble foundations that are particularly susceptible to moisture infiltration. The Speed River and Eramosa River valleys create naturally humid conditions during summer months, while the heavy clay soil composition in much of Guelph prevents proper drainage away from foundation walls. Basements in these historic homes often have that persistent musty smell that indicates active mold and mildew growth behind walls and under flooring. University of Guelph area rental properties frequently suffer from inadequate ventilation combined with high occupancy, creating perfect conditions for excess humidity and condensation on windows. The limestone-rich soil also contributes to efflorescence on basement walls where moisture carries mineral deposits through the concrete. Whole-home dehumidification is essential for protecting Guelph homes from the structural damage that unchecked moisture causes over time.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1890s home in the Ward had a perpetually damp basement that ruined everything we stored down there. B.A.P installed a whole-home dehumidifier tied into our ductwork and the difference is remarkable. No more musty smell and humidity stays at 45% even in August."
