localContext: |
  Breslau sits along the Grand River near its confluence with the Speed River, creating naturally humid conditions that affect homes throughout this growing community. The village's proximity to two major rivers means the water table remains elevated, influencing groundwater conditions across residential properties. Historic homes in the original village centre have older foundations that allow moisture migration over time, while extensive new residential development has transformed former agricultural land into modern subdivisions. These newer homes were often built on clay soil that holds moisture against foundations, and the disruption of natural drainage patterns during development can create unexpected groundwater issues. The river valley topography means humid air settles in lower areas during summer months, raising indoor humidity levels throughout the community. Properties near the Grand River or in low-lying areas experience particularly challenging moisture conditions that portable dehumidifiers cannot adequately address. The combination of river proximity, clay soil, and mixed housing stock makes basement humidity a common concern for Breslau homeowners. Whole-home dehumidification provides the comprehensive moisture control needed to protect both heritage and newer Breslau homes.
