localContext: |
  Shelburne sits at elevated terrain in Dufferin County near the headwaters of multiple river systems, where abundant groundwater affects homes throughout the community. The town's historic core features properties built during the railway era with foundations that predate modern waterproofing techniques. These older homes often have basements with stone or early concrete block construction that allows moisture infiltration over time. Newer residential development on the edges of Shelburne was built on former agricultural land with clay soil that holds water against foundations. The high water table in this area means many properties experience persistent basement dampness even without obvious drainage problems. Rural properties surrounding Shelburne frequently have wells on the same property, indicating the abundant groundwater that can affect basement moisture levels. Summer humidity in Shelburne, while moderate compared to lakefront communities, still exceeds comfortable indoor levels during July and August. Many homeowners notice that musty basement smell that persists despite ventilation efforts, along with condensation on windows and visible mold in corners. These symptoms indicate humidity problems that require whole-home dehumidification to resolve effectively.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our home near downtown Shelburne had a basement that was always damp. We assumed it was normal for older homes until we learned about whole-home dehumidifiers. B.A.P installed one and the difference is like having a completely different basement."
