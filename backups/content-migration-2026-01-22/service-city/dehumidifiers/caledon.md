localContext: |
  Caledon's rural and semi-rural character means many properties feature older farmhouses, estate homes, and country properties with unique moisture challenges. The rolling terrain along the Niagara Escarpment creates varied groundwater conditions, with some properties sitting on natural springs or in drainage paths that funnel water toward foundations. Historic farmhouses in Caledon East, Mono Mills, and surrounding areas often have stone or rubble foundations that allow significant moisture infiltration during wet seasons. The Credit River and Humber River headwaters flow through Caledon, contributing to elevated groundwater levels in adjacent areas. Newer estate properties built on former agricultural land sometimes encounter unexpected moisture problems when construction disrupts established drainage patterns. The combination of clay soil, escarpment geology, and abundant groundwater makes basement humidity a persistent issue throughout Caledon. Large homes with extensive finished basements require substantial dehumidification capacity to maintain comfortable humidity levels. Property owners storing valuable items, maintaining wine cellars, or using basements as living space need reliable humidity control that portable units simply cannot provide.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our estate property in Caledon has a large finished basement that was always humid despite running three portable dehumidifiers. B.A.P installed a 135-pint whole-home unit and the difference is remarkable. One unit does what three could not accomplish."
