localContext: |
  Eden Mills is a small historic village along the Eramosa River, where the mill heritage that gave the community its name reflects the abundant water resources that continue to influence local humidity conditions. This picturesque hamlet features heritage properties dating back to the early settlement period, many with stone foundations constructed using local materials that allow moisture infiltration over time. The Eramosa River creates elevated ambient humidity throughout the village, particularly during summer months when morning mist rises from the water and settles in the valley. The narrow river valley traps humid air, creating a microclimate that affects even properties not directly adjacent to the water. Many Eden Mills homes have basements that were original root cellars, never intended for the living space or storage use they now serve. The surrounding rural landscape has clay soil that holds moisture against foundations during wet seasons. Properties in this historic village often experience that persistent musty smell that indicates active moisture problems requiring more than portable dehumidifiers to resolve. Whole-home dehumidification protects these heritage properties from the moisture damage that the riverside location can cause over time.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our heritage home in Eden Mills sits right along the river and the basement was impossibly damp every summer. We thought it was just part of living in an old house until B.A.P showed us what whole-home dehumidification could do. Complete transformation."
