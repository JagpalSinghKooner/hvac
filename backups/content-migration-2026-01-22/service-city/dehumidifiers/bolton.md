localContext: |
  Bolton, located in the Town of Caledon, combines historic village character with newer residential development, and both face humidity challenges shaped by local conditions. The Humber River flows through Bolton, contributing to elevated groundwater levels and ambient humidity in adjacent neighbourhoods. Downtown Bolton features heritage properties from the 1800s with stone foundations that absorb moisture readily, while the village's location in a natural valley means humid air can settle and persist during summer months. Newer subdivisions on the edges of Bolton were built on agricultural land with clay soil that holds moisture against foundations. The transition from farmland to residential development disrupted natural drainage patterns, leaving some properties with persistent groundwater issues that manifest as damp basements and musty odors. Many Bolton homeowners struggle with humidity that portable dehumidifiers cannot control, particularly during the humid summer months when outdoor humidity regularly exceeds 70%. Mold growth in basements, condensation on windows, and that distinctive damp smell indicate humidity levels that require whole-home dehumidification to resolve properly.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our home near the Humber River in Bolton had basement moisture issues every summer. We could smell the dampness throughout the house. B.A.P installed a whole-home dehumidifier and the musty smell is completely gone. Our basement is finally usable."
