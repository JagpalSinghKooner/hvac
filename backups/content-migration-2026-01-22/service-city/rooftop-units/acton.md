localContext: |
  Acton's historic leather tanning heritage has evolved into a diverse commercial sector with varied RTU requirements. The industrial areas along Eastern Avenue and the 401 corridor house manufacturing and distribution facilities requiring reliable rooftop HVAC systems. The historic Main Street downtown presents retrofit challenges for commercial buildings in the heritage core housing restaurants, shops, and professional services. The Acton Arena and community facilities add institutional climate control demands. The leather goods and manufacturing tradition continues in modern facilities needing industrial-grade climate control. Acton's position in Halton Hills provides access to the Greater Toronto Area market while maintaining small-town commercial character with specialized HVAC needs.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our leather goods manufacturing facility requires specific humidity control to maintain material quality. B.A.P installed RTUs with humidity management that protects our inventory and improves our production environment. Quality has improved since the installation."
