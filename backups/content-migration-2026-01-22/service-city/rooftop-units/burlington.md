localContext: |
  Burlington's prosperous commercial sector features high-quality RTU installations across its business parks and retail corridors. The QEW corridor business parks house corporate headquarters and professional offices requiring reliable climate control for their workforce. Mapleview Centre and the surrounding retail developments utilize sophisticated multi-unit RTU systems, while the Appleby Line and Brant Street commercial corridors feature numerous plazas and strip malls with rooftop HVAC. The Burlington waterfront area presents unique installation challenges with lake-effect weather considerations, and the growing industrial sector near the 407 demands high-efficiency systems for modern warehousing and light manufacturing operations.
