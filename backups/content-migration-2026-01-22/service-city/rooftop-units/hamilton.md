The steel industry corridor along Burlington Street and the industrial zones in the east end feature heavy-duty rooftop units serving manufacturing and processing facilities. McMaster Innovation Park and the growing health sciences cluster require precision climate control for research and medical facilities. Limeridge Mall and the Upper James retail corridor utilize extensive RTU systems, while the revitalized downtown core presents retrofit opportunities for heritage commercial buildings. The Hamilton port area and associated logistics facilities demand reliable climate control for warehousing operations serving the Great Lakes shipping network.
