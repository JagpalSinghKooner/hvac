localContext: |
  Eden Mills' small village character includes select commercial establishments requiring specialized RTU service. The historic mill buildings along the Eramosa River have been converted to commercial and creative uses requiring sensitive climate control installations that preserve heritage character. The annual Eden Mills Writers' Festival brings attention to the village's cultural venues needing reliable HVAC for events. Local artisan workshops, studios, and small commercial enterprises serve the creative community with specialized climate control requirements for materials and equipment. The surrounding rural area includes country commercial operations and agricultural businesses with rooftop HVAC needs. Eden Mills' proximity to Guelph connects it to the broader commercial service network.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our converted mill studio space required climate control that would not damage sensitive art materials and maintain consistent humidity. B.A.P installed an RTU with humidity control that protects our work while keeping energy costs reasonable."
