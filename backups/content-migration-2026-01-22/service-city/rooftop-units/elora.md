localContext: |
  Elora's heritage village character and thriving tourism economy create specialized RTU requirements for its commercial sector. The historic mill district along the Grand River houses restaurants, galleries, and boutiques in converted stone buildings requiring sensitive climate control installations. The Elora Mill Hotel and surrounding hospitality businesses demand reliable HVAC for guest comfort throughout the tourist season. Downtown Elora's Metcalfe Street shops and cafes operate in heritage buildings where rooftop installations must respect architectural character while providing modern efficiency. The surrounding countryside includes wineries, craft breweries, and event venues with commercial HVAC needs. The Elora Gorge Conservation Area attracts seasonal tourism, making reliable business climate control essential.

  testimonial: "Our boutique hotel in a heritage building needed climate control upgrades without visible exterior equipment. B.A.P installed discrete rooftop units with concealed ductwork that maintain our historic aesthetic while providing modern guest comfort."
