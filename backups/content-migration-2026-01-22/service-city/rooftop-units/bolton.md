localContext: |
  Bolton has emerged as a major industrial and logistics hub with extensive RTU installations serving its commercial sector. The industrial parks along Highway 50 and Coleraine Drive house large distribution centres, manufacturing plants, and logistics facilities operated by national and international companies requiring high-capacity rooftop units. The Queen Street commercial corridor features retail plazas and strip malls with multi-unit RTU systems serving local businesses. Bolton's growth as a bedroom community has attracted supporting commercial services including medical offices, fitness centres, and professional services requiring reliable climate control. The nearby aggregate operations and construction industry suppliers require durable RTU systems for dusty industrial environments.
