localContext: |
  Georgetown serves as the commercial heart of Halton Hills with extensive RTU installations across its growing business community. The Armstrong Avenue industrial corridor houses manufacturing facilities and distribution operations requiring heavy-duty rooftop units. The Georgetown Marketplace and surrounding retail developments feature multi-unit RTU systems serving national and local tenants. The historic downtown along Main Street presents retrofit opportunities for heritage commercial buildings housing boutiques, restaurants, and professional offices. The 401 corridor accessibility has attracted logistics and distribution facilities with high-capacity climate control requirements. The Georgetown GO station area is seeing commercial development requiring modern HVAC installations for transit-oriented businesses.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our retail plaza required RTU replacements across eight units without disrupting our tenants during business hours. B.A.P coordinated overnight installations over two weeks and every tenant remained operational. Impressive project management."
