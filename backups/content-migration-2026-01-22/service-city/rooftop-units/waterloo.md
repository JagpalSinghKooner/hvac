localContext: |
  Waterloo's position as Canada's technology capital creates unique RTU requirements across its commercial infrastructure. The David Johnston Research and Technology Park houses numerous tech companies and research facilities requiring precise environmental control for laboratories and data centres. Insurance company headquarters and financial services offices along King Street demand reliable climate control for their workforce. The Conestoga Mall and surrounding retail developments feature extensive RTU systems, while the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University campuses present institutional-scale HVAC challenges. The growing Northfield Drive industrial corridor adds warehouse and light manufacturing facilities to the service landscape.
