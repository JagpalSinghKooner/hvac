localContext: |
  Caledon's strategic location along the 410 extension has created substantial commercial and industrial RTU demands. The Bolton industrial area houses major manufacturing and distribution facilities serving the Greater Toronto Area, requiring high-capacity rooftop units for their operations. The Mayfield Road corridor features growing retail and commercial developments with multi-unit RTU systems. Caledon's rural character includes equestrian facilities, golf courses, and country estates with commercial-grade HVAC requirements. The Caledon East and Mono Mills villages present smaller commercial installations for local businesses, while the gravel and aggregate industry facilities require durable RTU systems capable of handling dusty environments and heavy industrial loads.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our equestrian facility requires climate control for our indoor arena and stable buildings. B.A.P installed RTUs that handle our unique ventilation requirements while maintaining comfortable temperatures for horses and riders year-round."
