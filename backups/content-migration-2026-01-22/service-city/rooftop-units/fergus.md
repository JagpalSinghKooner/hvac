localContext: |
  Fergus serves as a commercial hub for Centre Wellington with diverse RTU installations across its business community. The Tower Street industrial area houses manufacturing facilities and distribution operations requiring reliable rooftop HVAC systems. The Highway 6 commercial corridor features retail plazas, automotive dealerships, and service businesses with multi-unit RTU installations. Downtown Fergus's historic St. Andrew Street presents retrofit challenges for heritage stone buildings housing restaurants, shops, and professional offices. The Fergus Grand Theatre and community facilities add institutional HVAC demands, while the agricultural services sector includes feed mills and equipment dealers with industrial-grade climate control requirements.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our historic stone building in downtown Fergus needed climate control that preserved the heritage character. B.A.P designed a rooftop installation that is invisible from street level while providing modern efficiency. They understood heritage building constraints."
