localContext: |
  Orangeville serves as the commercial hub for Dufferin County, with RTU installations spanning its diverse business community. The Highway 10 corridor features retail plazas, big-box stores, and automotive dealerships all utilizing rooftop HVAC systems. The industrial areas in the east end house manufacturing and distribution facilities requiring heavy-duty climate control. Downtown Orangeville's historic Broadway presents retrofit challenges for heritage commercial buildings housing boutiques, restaurants, and professional offices. The Alder Street recreation complex and surrounding community facilities add institutional HVAC demands, while the agricultural services sector includes feed mills and processing facilities with specialized climate control requirements.

  testimonial: "Our agricultural supply warehouse requires specific temperature and humidity control to protect our inventory. B.A.P understood our industry requirements and installed RTUs with the proper controls. Product quality has improved significantly."
