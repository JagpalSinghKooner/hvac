localContext: |
  Brantford's manufacturing heritage and ongoing revitalization create diverse RTU service demands across its commercial landscape. The industrial corridors along the 403 highway and in the north end feature substantial manufacturing and warehousing facilities requiring heavy-duty rooftop units. The Lynden Park Mall area and surrounding retail developments utilize multi-unit RTU systems, while the revitalized downtown core presents both retrofit opportunities in heritage buildings and new installations in modern developments. Laurier Brantford and the growing education sector add institutional HVAC demands, and the nearby Six Nations community includes commercial facilities requiring reliable climate control. The casino and entertainment district demands premium climate control for customer comfort.
