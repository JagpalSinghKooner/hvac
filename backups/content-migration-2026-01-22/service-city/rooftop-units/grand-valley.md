localContext: |
  Grand Valley's small-town commercial sector serves the surrounding agricultural community with specialized RTU requirements. The Main Street corridor features local retail, restaurants, and service businesses utilizing rooftop HVAC systems sized appropriately for smaller commercial buildings. The surrounding countryside includes grain elevators, agricultural processing facilities, and farm equipment dealers requiring industrial-grade climate control for their operations and inventory storage. Grand Valley's growing residential development has attracted supporting commercial services including medical offices, professional services, and retail businesses needing reliable climate control. The town's position in the Headwaters region makes it a service centre for rural commercial enterprises throughout the area.

  testimonial: "Our agricultural equipment dealership requires climate control for our showroom, parts department, and service bays. B.A.P installed a multi-zone RTU system that provides different temperatures for each area. Energy costs are lower than our old system."
