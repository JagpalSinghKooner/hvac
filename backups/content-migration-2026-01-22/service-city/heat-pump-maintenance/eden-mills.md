localContext: |
  Eden Mills has gained recognition for its environmental leadership, famously becoming one of Canada's first carbon-neutral communities. This commitment to sustainability has naturally led many Eden Mills homeowners to adopt heat pump technology for their heating and cooling needs. The small village along the Eramosa River creates a tight-knit community where word-of-mouth recommendations matter, and our reputation for quality heat pump maintenance has served us well here. The rural setting means many properties rely on their heat pumps as primary systems without natural gas backup, making proper maintenance essential. Our technicians share the environmental values that define Eden Mills, delivering bi-annual service that keeps these important systems running at peak efficiency while minimizing environmental impact.
