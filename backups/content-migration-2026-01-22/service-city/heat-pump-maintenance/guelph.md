localContext: |
  Guelph homeowners have embraced heat pump technology at remarkable rates, driven by the city's strong environmental consciousness and commitment to sustainability. The Royal City's diverse housing stock, from historic stone homes in the downtown core to modern developments in the south end, presents unique maintenance requirements for heat pump systems. Our technicians understand how Guelph's position along the Speed River creates localized humidity patterns that affect outdoor unit performance, particularly during shoulder seasons when heat pumps work hardest transitioning between heating and cooling modes. We've maintained heat pumps throughout Guelph's distinct neighbourhoods, from the tree-lined streets of the Ward to newer installations in the Hanlon Creek area, ensuring each system operates at peak efficiency year-round.
