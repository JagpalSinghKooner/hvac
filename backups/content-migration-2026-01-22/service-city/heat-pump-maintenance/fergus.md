localContext: |
  Fergus combines Scottish heritage charm with modern energy consciousness, making it a community where heat pumps have found strong acceptance among homeowners. The town's position along the Grand River creates humidity patterns and temperature variations that affect heat pump operation, particularly during shoulder seasons when systems switch frequently between heating and cooling. Our technicians are familiar with Fergus's distinctive stone architecture downtown and the growing subdivisions on the outskirts, each presenting different installation configurations and maintenance access considerations. The annual Scottish Festival draws visitors from across Ontario to appreciate Fergus's character, but residents know the true value is in year-round comfort. Our bi-annual maintenance ensures Fergus heat pumps perform reliably whether hosting summer gatherings or weathering winter storms.
