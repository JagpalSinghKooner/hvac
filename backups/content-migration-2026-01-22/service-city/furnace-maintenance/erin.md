localContext: |
  Erin's charming village atmosphere and surrounding rural properties create specific furnace maintenance considerations for residents. The town centre along Main Street features heritage homes and established properties with furnaces of varying ages and configurations. Many rural properties throughout Erin Township rely on propane heating systems requiring specialized maintenance knowledge and understanding of propane system dynamics. The rolling hills and Credit River valley location means Erin can experience significant temperature variations, with valley locations particularly prone to cold air pooling during winter nights. Properties at higher elevations on the surrounding hills may face different heating demands than those in the village proper. The community's distance from major urban centres makes preventive maintenance essential to avoid costly emergency service calls during severe weather. Schedule maintenance in late August or early September to ensure availability before winter preparations begin. Common Erin maintenance discoveries include propane pressure issues after tank refills, rodent damage in rural installations, and humidity challenges in homes with well water systems.
