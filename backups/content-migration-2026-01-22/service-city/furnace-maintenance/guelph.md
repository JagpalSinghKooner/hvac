localContext: |
  Guelph homeowners understand the importance of reliable heating through our cold Southern Ontario winters. With the city's diverse housing stock ranging from historic stone homes in the Ward to newer developments in the south end near Kortright Hills, furnace maintenance requirements vary significantly. Many homes in established neighbourhoods like St. Georges Park and Exhibition Park feature furnaces that are 15-20 years old, making annual maintenance critical for extending equipment life. The proximity to the Speed River corridor means homes in areas like Riverside Park can experience higher humidity levels, which affects furnace components. We recommend scheduling maintenance in September or early October before temperatures drop, ensuring your system is optimized for Guelph's typically harsh January and February conditions. Common issues we find during Guelph maintenance visits include dirty flame sensors from hard water deposits, worn blower motor bearings, and cracked heat exchangers in aging units.
