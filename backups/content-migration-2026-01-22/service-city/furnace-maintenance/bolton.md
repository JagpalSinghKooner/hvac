localContext: |
  Bolton has grown from a small village to a thriving community within Caledon, creating a mix of housing ages and furnace maintenance requirements. The historic downtown along Queen Street features mature homes with heating systems updated over decades, while newer developments in areas like Harvest Moon and South Hill have modern high-efficiency equipment. Bolton's position in the Humber River Valley creates unique weather patterns with potential for temperature inversions and frost pockets affecting heating demands. The community's rapid growth means many homes built in the 2000s are now reaching the age where original equipment needs comprehensive maintenance attention. Families who commute to Toronto rely on dependable heating systems waiting for them after long winter drives home. The mix of natural gas in established areas and some propane systems on the community periphery requires versatile maintenance expertise. Schedule maintenance by early October to ensure your Bolton home is ready for winter. Common maintenance findings include filter sizing issues in newer homes, humidity control problems, and ductwork settling in properties on reclaimed farmland.
