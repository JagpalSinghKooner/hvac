localContext: |
  Shelburne's position as the highest town on the Greater Toronto Area's northern fringe means residents face some of the most demanding winter conditions in the region. This elevation brings earlier snowfall, colder sustained temperatures, and longer heating seasons extending from October through April. The town's historic core along Main Street features established homes with furnaces that have served through countless harsh winters, while newer developments in areas like Emerald Crossing and Summerhill have modern equipment designed for efficiency. Many properties surrounding Shelburne rely on propane heating, requiring maintenance technicians with expertise in both fuel types. The community's agricultural heritage means local housing ranges from renovated farmhouses to contemporary family homes, each with distinct heating system configurations. Shelburne winters regularly test furnace reliability, making annual maintenance not just recommended but essential for family safety and comfort. Schedule maintenance in late August or early September before the early onset of cold weather in this area. Common Shelburne maintenance findings include cold weather startup issues, propane system frost concerns, and overworked blower components from extended heating seasons.
