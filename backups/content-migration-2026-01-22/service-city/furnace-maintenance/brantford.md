localContext: |
  Brantford's rich industrial heritage means much of the city's housing stock dates from manufacturing boom periods, with furnaces in many homes now on their second or third replacement cycle. Historic neighbourhoods like West Brant and Eagle Place feature century homes with retrofitted heating systems requiring careful maintenance attention to ensure compatibility and safety. The downtown core along Colborne Street has seen significant revitalization with converted buildings presenting unique heating challenges. Newer developments in areas like Shellard Lane and near Wayne Gretzky Parkway feature modern equipment with different maintenance needs. The Grand River Valley location creates a microclimate that can experience temperature inversions and humidity variations affecting furnace operation. Brantford winters can be harsh with significant snowfall requiring dependable heating from late November through early April. Schedule maintenance by mid-October to ensure your system is ready. Common Brantford maintenance discoveries include deteriorated ductwork in older homes, gas pressure inconsistencies, and fan limit switch issues in frequently cycling systems.
