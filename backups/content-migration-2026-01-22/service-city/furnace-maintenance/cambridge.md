localContext: |
  Cambridge presents unique heating challenges with its tri-city heritage spanning Galt, Preston, and Hespeler. Each area has distinct housing characteristics that affect furnace maintenance needs. The historic downtown Galt area features many century homes with retrofitted heating systems requiring careful attention to ductwork compatibility and airflow balance. Preston's post-war housing stock typically has furnaces in the 12-18 year range, while newer subdivisions in areas like Southwood and Langs Farm feature modern high-efficiency units needing precision maintenance. Cambridge's location along the Grand River creates microclimates with varying humidity levels that impact furnace operation. The industrial heritage means many homes were built during boom periods with builder-grade equipment now reaching end of life. Schedule your maintenance before November to avoid the rush when temperatures near the river consistently drop below freezing. Common Cambridge maintenance findings include clogged condensate drains, deteriorating ignition systems, and filter neglect leading to reduced airflow.
