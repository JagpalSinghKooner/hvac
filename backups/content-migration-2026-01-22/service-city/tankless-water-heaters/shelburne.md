localContext: |
  Shelburne's rapid growth as a bedroom community for the GTA has brought families seeking affordable housing with modern amenities. The newer subdivisions expanding south and west feature homes designed with efficient systems in mind, while the established neighbourhoods near downtown offer character properties where tankless technology maximizes limited mechanical room space. Shelburne's location means cold winters with significant heating costs, making the energy efficiency of tankless systems particularly valuable for budget-conscious families. Many Shelburne households include commuters who appreciate reliable morning hot water after early wake-up routines. The agricultural roots of the surrounding area mean some properties rely on well water, requiring careful attention to water quality and maintenance planning. Growing families moving to Shelburne for affordability find tankless systems offer excellent long-term value with 15-20 year lifespans. The community's young demographic appreciates the environmental benefits of reduced energy consumption.
