localContext: |
  Georgetown's blend of historic charm and modern development makes it ideal for tankless water heater adoption. The established neighbourhoods near downtown feature century homes with unique character and often limited mechanical room space where wall-mounted tankless units excel. The newer subdivisions spreading toward Highway 7 bring young families who expect efficient, modern home systems. Georgetown's GO Transit access attracts commuters whose busy morning routines demand reliable hot water without the wait times of depleted tanks. The town's strong sports culture means families with children in hockey, lacrosse, and other activities generating significant laundry demands. Local water hardness requires proper attention to maintenance schedules and descaling requirements. Georgetown homeowners appreciate the dual benefits of tankless technology, both the immediate endless hot water and the long-term savings of up to 40% on water heating costs over the 15-20 year system lifespan.

  testimonial: "Between my husband commuting to Toronto and getting three kids ready for school, our mornings were a hot water battleground. Tankless ended the conflict."
