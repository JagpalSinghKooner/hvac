localContext: |
  Guelph homeowners increasingly recognize the benefits of tankless water heater technology, particularly in the city's diverse housing stock ranging from historic stone homes in the downtown core to newer subdivisions in the south end. The University of Guelph brings thousands of students and faculty whose rental properties and family homes benefit from endless hot water supply. Guelph's commitment to environmental sustainability through initiatives like the Community Energy Plan aligns perfectly with the energy efficiency of tankless systems. Many larger Victorian-era homes in areas like the Ward have multiple bathrooms that strain traditional tank systems, while newer builds in developments near the Hanlon Expressway often feature smaller mechanical rooms where space-saving tankless units are ideal. Hard water in some Guelph neighbourhoods requires proper descaling maintenance, which we address during installation consultation.
