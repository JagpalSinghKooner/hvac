localContext: |
  Elora's artistic community and stunning natural beauty attract homeowners who appreciate both heritage character and modern efficiency. The village's limestone buildings and historic homes along Mill Street and near the Gorge feature unique architectural constraints where compact tankless units provide excellent solutions. Many Elora properties serve as weekend retreats or bed-and-breakfast accommodations, requiring reliable hot water for guests without the standby losses of keeping tanks heated during unoccupied periods. The Grand River's influence on local water conditions requires attention to proper system maintenance and descaling schedules. Elora's tourism-driven economy means many residents host visitors frequently, and endless hot water ensures every guest enjoys their stay. The environmentally conscious community appreciates tankless technology's reduced energy consumption and smaller carbon footprint. Artists and craftspeople working from home studios value the space savings of wall-mounted units that free up workshop area.
