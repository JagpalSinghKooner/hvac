localContext: |
  Fergus combines Scottish heritage charm with modern community growth, creating diverse opportunities for tankless water heater installations. The historic stone and brick homes downtown and along the Grand River feature beautiful architecture but often cramped basements where space-saving tankless technology shines. The newer developments expanding east toward Elora bring young families who expect efficient, modern home systems that keep up with active lifestyles. Fergus's position on the Grand River means local water conditions that require attention to proper maintenance planning. The Highland Games spirit extends to Fergus households where large family gatherings are common, and endless hot water ensures every guest enjoys their visit. Cold winter temperatures in Centre Wellington mean higher energy costs, making the efficiency savings of tankless systems particularly valuable. Fergus homeowners appreciate the longevity of tankless units, often lasting 15-20 years with proper maintenance and descaling.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We host family from Scotland regularly, and our old tank could never keep up. Now everyone gets hot showers no matter how full the house gets."
