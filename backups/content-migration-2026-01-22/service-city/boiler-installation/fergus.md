localContext: |
  Fergus stands out in Wellington County for its remarkable concentration of Scottish limestone heritage buildings, many of which retain original boiler and radiator heating systems. The historic downtown along St. Andrew Street and the beautiful stone homes throughout the village core showcase architecture that pairs perfectly with radiant heat distribution. The Templin Gardens area and streets near the Grand River feature substantial older homes where boilers have provided reliable warmth for over a century. Fergus homeowners often treasure their heritage properties and choose to upgrade boiler systems rather than convert to forced air, preserving both the character and the comfortable heating experience. The newer developments in Fergus also include custom homes where discerning owners specify in-floor radiant heating. The town's active heritage preservation community ensures continued demand for boiler expertise from contractors who understand older systems and heritage property requirements.
