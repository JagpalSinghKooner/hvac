localContext: |
  Orangeville's historic downtown along Broadway and the surrounding established neighbourhoods contain numerous heritage properties where boiler heating systems have provided reliable warmth for generations. The town's position at the headwaters of the Credit River gives it a slightly cooler microclimate than communities further south, making reliable heating essential. Many homes in the Montgomery Village area and near Island Lake Conservation Area feature boiler systems, as do the older properties along First Street and around the town's Victorian-era core. Orangeville's rural surroundings include country properties and hobby farms where boiler systems are chosen for their ability to heat large, open spaces consistently. The town's growing population of commuters and young families rediscovering older homes has increased demand for boiler replacements that maintain comfortable radiant heat while dramatically improving efficiency.

  testimonial: "Our century home near Broadway had a boiler that was original to the house. B.A.P handled the replacement professionally, maintaining our beautiful radiators while giving us modern efficiency. The difference in our gas bills is substantial."
