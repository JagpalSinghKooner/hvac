localContext: |
  Brantford's rich industrial heritage has left the city with an impressive stock of Victorian and Edwardian homes where boiler heating remains the standard. The downtown core along Colborne Street, the historic West Brant neighbourhood, and the grand homes of Dufferin Avenue feature substantial brick construction with original radiator systems. Eagle Place and Holmedale contain numerous worker housing from Brantford's manufacturing heyday, many heated by boilers that are now decades old and due for replacement. The city's revitalization has attracted homeowners who appreciate the character of these older properties and the comfortable, even heat that radiator systems provide. Brantford's affordable heritage housing stock means many first-time buyers encounter boiler systems for the first time and need guidance on replacement options that maintain their home's heating comfort while improving efficiency significantly.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We bought a beautiful brick home in West Brant with a boiler from the 1960s. B.A.P replaced it with a modern efficient unit that works perfectly with our radiators. The consistent warmth throughout the house is remarkable."
