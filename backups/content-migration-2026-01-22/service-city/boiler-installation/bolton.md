localContext: |
  Bolton's village character and surrounding rural properties create a mix of boiler heating applications. The historic downtown core along Queen Street features older commercial and residential buildings where boiler systems have provided heat for decades. The established neighbourhoods near Dick's Dam Park and the Humber River valley contain mature homes with radiator heating that homeowners maintain for its comfort and reliability. Bolton's growth has brought new custom homes in areas like Crestwood Downs where discerning builders incorporate in-floor radiant heating for its luxury feel and invisible heat delivery. The rural properties surrounding Bolton, including hobby farms and estate homes along regional roads, often choose boiler systems for heating large custom homes, workshops, and agricultural buildings. Bolton residents appreciate the quiet, draft-free comfort that hydronic heating provides compared to conventional forced air systems.
