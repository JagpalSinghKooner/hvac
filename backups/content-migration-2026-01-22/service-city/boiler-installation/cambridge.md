localContext: |
  Cambridge's three historic cores of Galt, Preston, and Hespeler each contain significant concentrations of older homes where boiler heating systems are prevalent. The mill town heritage of these communities means many properties date from the late 1800s to early 1900s, built when boiler systems were standard. Downtown Galt along the Grand River features beautiful Victorian and Edwardian homes with original radiator systems, while Preston's established streets near Central Park showcase similar heritage construction. Blair Village and the older sections of Hespeler also maintain numerous boiler-heated properties. The substantial brick and stone construction in these areas benefits from the steady, even heat that boiler systems provide, and many Cambridge homeowners choose to upgrade their boilers rather than convert to forced air to preserve the character and comfort of their historic properties.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Preston home near Central Park had a boiler from the 1970s that was incredibly inefficient. B.A.P replaced it with a modern condensing unit that cut our gas bills dramatically while keeping our radiators."
