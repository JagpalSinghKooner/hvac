localContext: |
  Burlington's affluent lakefront neighbourhoods and established areas like Roseland, Shoreacres, and Indian Point feature executive homes where in-floor radiant heating and high-end boiler systems are increasingly popular. The older downtown core near Brant Street and the heritage properties along Ontario Street maintain traditional boiler and radiator systems that homeowners value for their quiet, comfortable heat. Burlington's discerning homeowners often choose hydronic heating for basement renovations, additions, and custom builds, appreciating the luxury of warm floors in bathrooms and living spaces. The Aldershot neighbourhood contains numerous mid-century homes with original boiler systems due for replacement. Tyandaga and the established streets near LaSalle Park also feature boiler-heated properties where homeowners seek modern high-efficiency replacements that preserve their comfortable radiant heat delivery.

  testimonial: "When we built our custom home in Roseland, we insisted on in-floor radiant throughout. B.A.P installed a dual-boiler system that provides incredible comfort and efficiency. Walking on warm floors in January is pure luxury."
