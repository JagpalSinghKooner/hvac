localContext: |
  Milton's mix of historic downtown properties and rapidly expanding new developments creates diverse boiler installation needs. The original town centre around Main Street and Martin Street features heritage buildings and older homes where radiator heating systems remain prevalent. These established properties often have boilers dating back decades that require modern high-efficiency replacements. Meanwhile, Milton's explosive growth has brought custom home construction in areas like Scott, Willmott, and Beaty where discerning homeowners increasingly specify in-floor radiant heating for the ultimate in comfort. The rural estate properties on Milton's outskirts, particularly toward Campbellville and the escarpment, often choose boiler systems for their reliability and compatibility with larger custom homes. Milton homeowners appreciate that boilers provide consistent, comfortable heat without the drafts and noise of forced air systems.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We built a custom home near the escarpment and chose in-floor radiant throughout after experiencing it elsewhere. B.A.P designed and installed a system that keeps our 4,000 square foot home perfectly comfortable all winter."
