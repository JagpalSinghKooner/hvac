localContext: |
  Georgetown's charming downtown along Main Street and the established neighbourhoods near Fairy Lake contain numerous heritage properties where boiler heating with radiators has been the standard for over a century. The historic core features beautiful Victorian and Edwardian homes where homeowners maintain original radiator systems for their character and comfortable heat delivery. The Delrex area and older sections of Georgetown include mid-century homes with boiler heating systems now due for modern, efficient replacements. Georgetown's growth has brought custom home construction in areas like Silver Creek where discerning buyers increasingly specify in-floor radiant heating for luxury and efficiency. The town's mix of heritage charm and new development creates demand for contractors skilled in both traditional boiler replacement and modern hydronic system design. Georgetown's professional commuter population often invests in quality heating upgrades that improve both comfort and property value.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1890s home on Main Street needed a boiler that could handle its quirky old radiator layout. B.A.P took the time to understand our system and installed a replacement that heats every room perfectly. Their heritage home expertise made the difference."
