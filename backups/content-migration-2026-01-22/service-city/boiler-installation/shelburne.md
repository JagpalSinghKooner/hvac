localContext: |
  Shelburne's position as a gateway to Dufferin County's rural landscape means the town serves homeowners with diverse boiler heating needs. The historic downtown core along Main Street features older commercial and residential buildings where boiler systems have provided reliable heat through harsh winters for generations. Shelburne sits at a higher elevation than communities to the south, experiencing colder temperatures that make dependable heating essential. The town's older neighbourhoods contain homes with traditional radiator systems requiring modern replacements, while the surrounding agricultural properties include farmhouses where boilers heat large, drafty structures effectively. New custom homes on Shelburne's expanding edges increasingly specify in-floor radiant heating for its comfort and efficiency. The farming and rural community around Shelburne appreciates boiler systems for their ability to heat workshops, barns, and outbuildings where forced air would be impractical.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our farmhouse outside Shelburne was impossible to keep warm with the old boiler struggling through every winter. B.A.P installed a properly sized high-efficiency unit that finally heats our home evenly. We should have done this years ago."
