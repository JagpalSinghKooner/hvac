localContext: |
  Guelph's historic downtown core and established neighbourhoods like the Ward, St. Patrick's Ward, and Exhibition Park feature numerous century homes where boiler systems with radiators remain the preferred heating method. These heritage properties often have original cast iron radiators that homeowners wish to preserve, making boiler replacement rather than full system conversion the logical choice. The stone and brick construction common in Old University and Brooklyn-College Hill provides excellent thermal mass that pairs beautifully with radiant heat distribution. Many Guelph homeowners appreciate the quiet, even warmth that boilers provide compared to forced air systems, particularly in these older homes with plaster walls and hardwood floors where ductwork installation would be disruptive and costly.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1890s stone home in the Ward had the original boiler finally give out. B.A.P installed a new high-efficiency unit that works perfectly with our cast iron radiators. The house has never been warmer."
