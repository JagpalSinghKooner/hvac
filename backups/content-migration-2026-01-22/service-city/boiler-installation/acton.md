localContext: |
  Acton's industrial heritage as a leather tanning centre left the town with a substantial inventory of Victorian and Edwardian worker housing where boiler heating remains common. The historic downtown along Mill Street and the established neighbourhoods near Fairy Lake feature older homes with radiator systems that provide comfortable, even heat. Acton's heritage buildings, including converted industrial structures, often retain boiler heating that building owners maintain for its reliability and compatibility with historic architecture. The surrounding rural areas include farmhouses and estate properties where boiler systems excel at heating large, open floor plans. Acton's position within Halton Hills attracts homeowners who appreciate the town's small-town character and heritage properties, many of whom choose to upgrade their boiler systems rather than convert to forced air. The community's mix of heritage charm and practical rural sensibility values heating systems that deliver reliable, comfortable warmth.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We purchased a Victorian worker cottage near Fairy Lake that had its original radiators but a failing boiler. B.A.P installed a modern system that brings out the best in our historic heating setup. The house feels cozy and authentic."
