localContext: |
  Rockwood's picturesque village setting near the Eramosa River features historic stone and brick buildings where boiler heating with radiators has been the standard for well over a century. The downtown core along Main Street and Harris Street contains heritage properties that homeowners carefully maintain, including original heating systems that require modern, efficient replacements. The old mill buildings and converted heritage structures throughout Rockwood often retain radiator systems that owners prefer to preserve. Rockwood Conservation Area draws visitors and new residents who appreciate the village's historic character and choose homes with traditional heating systems. The surrounding rural properties, including hobby farms and estate homes between Rockwood and Guelph, often feature boiler heating for its reliability and ability to heat large, custom structures evenly. Rockwood's community values heritage preservation, making boiler expertise essential for local heating contractors.
