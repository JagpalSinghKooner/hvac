localContext: |
  Oakville's prestigious neighbourhoods along the lakefront including Bronte, Old Oakville, and Morrison feature many executive and heritage homes where boiler heating systems are the standard. The historic downtown core near Lakeshore Road contains beautiful Victorian and Edwardian properties with original radiator systems that homeowners maintain and upgrade. Custom homes in areas like Clearview, Glen Abbey, and Joshua Creek increasingly incorporate in-floor radiant heating throughout, with homeowners appreciating the comfort and invisible heat delivery. Oakville's affluent homeowner base often invests in premium heating solutions, choosing high-efficiency condensing boilers with smart controls for maximum performance. The established neighbourhoods of River Oaks and Falgarwood also feature numerous boiler-heated homes where owners seek quality replacement installations that maintain their comfortable, quiet heating experience.
