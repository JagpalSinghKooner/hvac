localContext: |
  Caledon's rural character and estate properties make it ideal territory for boiler heating systems. The rolling hills and large lot sizes throughout communities like Inglewood, Belfountain, and Alton feature custom homes and renovated farmhouses where hydronic heating provides superior comfort. Many Caledon properties have workshops, studios, or heated outbuildings where in-floor radiant systems deliver practical, even warmth. The horse farms and agricultural properties throughout the township often choose boilers for their reliability and ability to heat large spaces efficiently. Caledon Village and the historic areas contain older homes with traditional radiator systems requiring modern replacements. The municipality's strict development controls have preserved rural character while attracting homeowners who invest in quality heating systems, making high-efficiency boilers a popular choice for both new construction and renovation projects throughout Caledon.
