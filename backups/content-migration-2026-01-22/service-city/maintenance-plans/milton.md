localContext: |
  Milton has experienced tremendous growth over the past two decades, transforming from a small town into a thriving community with diverse HVAC maintenance needs. The historic downtown core contains character homes with older heating systems, while extensive new developments in the south and west feature modern high-efficiency equipment requiring precise calibration. Milton's location at the base of the Niagara Escarpment means slightly different weather patterns than surrounding communities, with cooler temperatures and increased snowfall affecting heating system demand. Many Milton residents commute to Toronto or other employment centres, making automated maintenance scheduling valuable for busy families. The town's newer homes often include advanced features like variable-speed furnaces, two-stage air conditioners, and smart thermostats that benefit from professional attention to maintain their efficiency advantages. Regular maintenance helps Milton homeowners maximize their equipment's performance while preventing the inconvenient breakdowns that disrupt family schedules.
