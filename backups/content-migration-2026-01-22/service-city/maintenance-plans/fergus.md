localContext: |
  Fergus combines Scottish heritage charm with practical HVAC maintenance needs shaped by its position along the Grand River in Centre Wellington. The historic downtown features beautiful stone buildings and character homes with heating systems spanning multiple generations of technology. Many properties utilize the distinctive limestone construction that defines Fergus architecture, and these homes have unique heating requirements due to their thermal mass characteristics. The Grand River corridor creates local humidity and temperature patterns affecting both heating and cooling system performance. Newer residential developments have brought modern high-efficiency equipment to the community, creating diverse maintenance needs across different neighbourhoods. Fergus residents value quality craftsmanship and service providers who take time to do things right. Our maintenance plans deliver thorough, professional care that matches the community's appreciation for quality while protecting homeowners' equipment investments through demanding seasonal cycles.
