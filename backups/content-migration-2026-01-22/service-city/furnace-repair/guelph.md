localContext: |
  Guelph's diverse housing stock presents unique furnace repair challenges that our technicians handle daily. The historic stone homes in the Ward and Downtown area often have older heating systems that require specialized diagnostic expertise, while newer developments in the South End and Kortright Hills feature high-efficiency units that demand modern troubleshooting skills. Guelph experiences significant temperature swings during winter months, with the Speed River valley creating localized cold pockets that push furnaces harder than surrounding areas. Common repair calls in Guelph include igniter failures in older homes near the University of Guelph campus, blower motor issues in St. Patrick's Ward properties, and heat exchanger problems in Exhibition Park area residences. Our emergency response teams are strategically positioned to reach any Guelph neighbourhood within 45 minutes, ensuring rapid service when your furnace fails during a cold snap.
