localContext: |
  Cambridge's tri-city heritage means our technicians encounter an exceptional variety of furnace systems across Galt, Preston, and Hespeler. The grand Victorian homes along the Grand River in Galt often house older gravity-fed or converted systems that require experienced hands, while Preston's post-war bungalows typically feature mid-efficiency furnaces approaching end-of-life. Hespeler's mix of heritage properties and newer subdivisions near Pinebush Road presents diverse repair scenarios daily. Cambridge winters are intensified by the Grand River corridor, creating damp cold that accelerates wear on heat exchangers and burner components. We frequently address flame sensor issues in Blair-area homes, inducer motor failures in Langs Farm properties, and thermostat wiring problems in older Downtown Galt residences. Our Cambridge-based technicians maintain full parts inventory for rapid repairs, minimizing your time without heat.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Woke up to a freezing house on a Saturday morning. Called B.A.P and they had someone here within 40 minutes. The tech found a cracked inducer motor, replaced it on the spot, and even cleaned our flame sensor as a preventive measure. True professionals."
