seoDescription: 'Ductless mini split installation in Cambridge, ON. Perfect for additions and problem rooms. Serving Cambridge since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Cambridge's three distinct cores of Galt, Preston, and Hespeler each present unique opportunities for ductless mini split installations. The historic textile mill workers' homes in Galt's downtown often feature radiator heating with no existing ductwork, making mini splits the most practical option for adding air conditioning without major renovations. Preston's riverside properties frequently include converted porches and additions that were never connected to the main heating system. Hespeler's growing population of young families converting basements and attics into living spaces find zone control particularly valuable. The Grand River valley creates humidity challenges in summer months that mini splits address efficiently through built-in dehumidification. Cambridge homeowners increasingly choose multi-zone systems for their ability to heat and cool different areas independently, eliminating the hot-upstairs-cold-basement problem common in older two-storey homes. Our technicians understand Cambridge's diverse housing stock and recommend appropriately sized systems for everything from compact condos near the downtown cores to sprawling properties in Blair and Greengate.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1920s home in Galt had beautiful radiators but no way to add AC. B.A.P installed a three-zone mini split system that keeps our main floor, upstairs, and finished attic comfortable without touching the historic interior."
