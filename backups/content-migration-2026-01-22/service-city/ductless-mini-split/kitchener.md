localContext: |
  Kitchener's transformation from industrial hub to tech centre has brought new demands on residential heating and cooling systems. The established neighbourhoods of Victoria Park, Cedar Hill, and Centreville feature homes from the early 1900s where adding ductwork would require significant structural modifications. Mini splits allow these homeowners to enjoy modern comfort without sacrificing original hardwood floors, plaster walls, or architectural details. The city's booming tech sector means more residents work from home, and dedicated mini split zones in home offices ensure productivity without heating or cooling unused rooms. Forest Heights and Stanley Park families converting basements into playrooms or teen retreats benefit from independent temperature control. Kitchener's four distinct seasons demand HVAC solutions that handle both heating and cooling efficiently, and modern mini splits with heat pump technology deliver year-round comfort with a single outdoor unit. Our installation teams work throughout Kitchener daily, from the dense urban core to the newer developments in Doon South and Huron Park, sizing and positioning systems for optimal performance.
