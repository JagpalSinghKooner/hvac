localContext: |
  Brantford's rich industrial heritage has left a diverse housing stock where ductless mini splits provide practical solutions for modern comfort needs. The downtown core and West Brant area feature beautiful Victorian and Edwardian homes built with radiator heating systems and no provisions for ductwork. Adding central air to these properties would require significant structural modifications and potential damage to original features. Mini splits allow these homeowners to enjoy cooling and supplemental heating without invasive renovations. The Holmedale and Eagle Place neighbourhoods include worker housing from the telephone city era, compact homes where adding ductwork simply is not feasible. East Ward and Terrace Hill residents frequently convert basements and attics into additional living space, and these areas often fall outside the effective range of existing HVAC systems. Brantford's location in the Grand River valley creates humid summer conditions that mini splits address through efficient dehumidification. The growing population of remote workers has increased demand for home office climate control, where a single-zone mini split maintains productivity without conditioning unused rooms.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Victorian home in West Brant had no AC and adding ducts would have destroyed the original plaster. B.A.P installed mini splits that cool the house beautifully without any damage to the historic details we love."
