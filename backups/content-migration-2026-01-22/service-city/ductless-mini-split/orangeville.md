localContext: |
  Orangeville's position as the gateway to the Headwaters region makes it home to diverse properties where ductless mini splits excel. The historic downtown Broadway corridor features buildings converted to residential use where ductwork installation would be impractical or impossible. The town's Victorian and Edwardian homes in the central neighbourhoods often rely on radiator heating, leaving homeowners without an easy path to air conditioning. Mini splits solve this elegantly without disturbing original architectural elements. Orangeville's rural character means many properties include workshops, home offices in converted outbuildings, and accessory structures that require independent climate control. The elevation creates colder winters than communities further south, and heat pump mini splits provide efficient heating even in sub-zero temperatures. The surrounding horse country and hobby farms of the Headwaters region include numerous barn conversions, studio spaces, and finished workshops where traditional HVAC would be cost-prohibitive. Our technicians understand the specific needs of Orangeville homeowners, from compact downtown properties to sprawling rural estates, and size systems appropriately for each application.
