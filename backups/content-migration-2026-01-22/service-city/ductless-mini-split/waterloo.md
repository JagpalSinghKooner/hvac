seoDescription: 'Ductless mini split installation in Waterloo, ON. Perfect for additions and problem rooms. Serving Waterloo since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Waterloo's unique blend of historic architecture and modern innovation makes ductless mini splits increasingly popular among residents. The Uptown core features century homes and converted commercial buildings where traditional ductwork installation would be prohibitively expensive or structurally impractical. University District properties near Wilfrid Laurier and the University of Waterloo often house multiple tenants who appreciate individual temperature control. Beechwood and Westmount families adding sunrooms, three-season rooms, and garage conversions find mini splits provide the targeted comfort these spaces need without overtaxing existing HVAC systems. Waterloo's sustainability-minded community appreciates that modern mini splits operate at efficiencies exceeding 400%, meaning they generate four units of heating for every unit of electricity consumed. The city's significant tech workforce has driven demand for home office climate control, where a single-zone mini split keeps the workspace comfortable without conditioning empty bedrooms. Our Waterloo technicians specialize in minimally invasive installations that preserve both historic character and modern aesthetics throughout neighbourhoods from Laurelwood to Lakeshore.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We converted our Uptown duplex attic into a rental suite but had no way to heat and cool it. B.A.P installed a mini split that gives our tenant independent control. It is efficient enough that we include utilities in the rent."
