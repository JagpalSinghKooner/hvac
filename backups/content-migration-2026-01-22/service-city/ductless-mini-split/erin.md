localContext: |
  Erin's charming village character and surrounding agricultural landscape make ductless mini splits an ideal climate control solution for many properties. The historic downtown core along Main Street features century homes and converted buildings where installing traditional ductwork would compromise architectural integrity. Many Erin homes rely on older heating systems like radiators, wood stoves, or propane furnaces with no existing ductwork for air conditioning. Mini splits allow these homeowners to add efficient heating and cooling without major renovations. The surrounding countryside includes numerous hobby farms, equestrian properties, and rural retreats with workshops, studios, and accessory buildings that require independent climate control. Erin's elevation in the Headwaters region produces cold winters where heat pump mini splits provide efficient heating even in sub-zero temperatures. The village's artistic community includes many residents with home-based studios and businesses in converted outbuildings where traditional HVAC proves impractical. Our technicians understand Erin's unique character and work carefully to install systems that deliver modern comfort while respecting the heritage aesthetics that make this community special.
