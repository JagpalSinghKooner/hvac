localContext: |
  Hamilton's dramatic topography creates unique heating and cooling challenges that ductless mini splits address effectively. The escarpment divides the city into distinct climate zones, with the Mountain experiencing different conditions than the lower city. Heritage homes in Durand, Kirkendall, and Westdale were built before air conditioning and often feature radiator or boiler heating with no ductwork. Mini splits provide these homeowners with efficient cooling and supplemental heating without invasive renovations. The city's industrial past left many properties with converted spaces like loft apartments in former factories and commercial-to-residential conversions where traditional HVAC proves impractical. Ancaster and Dundas homeowners frequently add sunrooms and conservatories that require independent climate control. Stoney Creek's newer developments sometimes include bonus rooms over garages that existing systems cannot adequately condition. Hamilton's humid summers near the waterfront make the dehumidification capabilities of mini splits particularly valuable. Our technicians serve the entire Hamilton area, understanding the specific challenges each neighbourhood presents and recommending appropriately sized systems.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Durand home had gorgeous original details but no AC. Window units were ruining the curb appeal. B.A.P installed mini splits with discrete wall units that blend right in, and we finally enjoy summers at home."
