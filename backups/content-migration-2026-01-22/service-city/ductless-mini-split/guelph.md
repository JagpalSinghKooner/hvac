localContext: |
  Guelph's eclectic mix of architectural styles makes ductless mini splits an ideal heating and cooling solution for many homeowners. The historic stone homes in the Ward and Downtown area often lack ductwork entirely, and retrofitting traditional HVAC would damage original plaster walls and heritage features. Mini splits provide efficient climate control without invasive installation. Many University of Guelph area properties have been converted from single-family homes to multi-unit rentals, where zone control allows individual temperature preferences in each unit. The city's commitment to sustainability aligns perfectly with mini split technology, as these systems achieve SEER ratings up to 30 and qualify for various rebate programs. South End additions and sunroom conversions are particularly well-suited for ductless systems, as extending existing ductwork often proves impractical. Our Guelph technicians regularly install mini splits in Kortright Hills home offices, Exhibition Park basement conversions, and St. Patrick's Ward attic bedrooms where traditional heating falls short.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We added a home office above our detached garage and heating it seemed impossible. B.A.P installed a single-zone mini split that keeps it comfortable year-round. Our energy bills barely changed, and we use the office every day now."
