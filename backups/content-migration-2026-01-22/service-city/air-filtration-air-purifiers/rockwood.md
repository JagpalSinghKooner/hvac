localContext: |
  Rockwood's charming village atmosphere and proximity to the Rockwood Conservation Area attract residents who value nature and outdoor recreation, but this setting brings specific indoor air quality considerations. The Eramosa River and surrounding wetlands contribute to elevated humidity levels that can promote mould growth in basements and older homes throughout the community. Rockwood's location near extensive forests and conservation lands means elevated pollen and mould spore counts during spring and summer months, affecting allergy sufferers throughout the village. The community's older homes, including many historic stone and brick buildings, feature aging systems where decades of dust and allergens have accumulated. Many Rockwood families embrace outdoor activities and pet ownership, regularly tracking pollen, dust, and allergens into their homes. The village's rural character means some properties experience dust from gravel roads and nearby agricultural operations that benefits from whole-home filtration.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We love hiking the conservation area but were bringing all those allergens home with us. The air purifier keeps our home clean no matter how much outdoor time we enjoy. It is like having the best of both worlds."
