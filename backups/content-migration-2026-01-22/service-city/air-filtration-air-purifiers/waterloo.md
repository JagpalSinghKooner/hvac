localContext: |
  Waterloo's tech-savvy population increasingly recognizes the importance of indoor air quality for productivity and health. The university district sees high tenant turnover, leaving accumulated pet dander, dust, and odours that new occupants inherit. Established neighbourhoods like Beechwood and Lakeshore North feature beautiful mature trees that unfortunately contribute to elevated pollen counts during allergy season. Many Waterloo professionals work from home, spending extended hours indoors where air quality directly impacts focus and wellbeing. The city's newer subdivisions in areas like Laurelwood and Vista Hills feature tightly sealed, energy-efficient homes that can trap pollutants, VOCs, and cooking odours without adequate ventilation or filtration. Waterloo families with young children are particularly concerned about airborne pathogens, especially during cold and flu season when windows stay closed for months at a time.
