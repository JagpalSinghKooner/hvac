localContext: |
  Burlington homeowners take pride in their lakeside community and increasingly prioritize indoor air quality for their families. The city's proximity to Lake Ontario creates humidity challenges that can promote mould and mildew growth, particularly in basements and lower levels of homes throughout Aldershot and the downtown core. Burlington's mature tree canopy in established neighbourhoods like Roseland and Tyandaga produces significant pollen during spring and early summer, affecting allergy sufferers across the city. Many Burlington families have relocated from larger urban centres, seeking cleaner air and a healthier lifestyle, making indoor air quality a natural priority. Pet ownership is exceptionally high in Burlington's family-oriented neighbourhoods, with dogs and cats contributing dander that accumulates in homes without proper filtration. The QEW corridor brings traffic-related pollutants that can infiltrate homes in southern Burlington near the highway.
