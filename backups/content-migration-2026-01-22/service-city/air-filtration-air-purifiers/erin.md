localContext: |
  Erin's picturesque rural setting and close-knit community appeal to families seeking escape from urban congestion, but country living brings indoor air quality considerations often overlooked by new residents. The village's location in the headwaters region means abundant forests and wetlands that contribute to elevated pollen and mould spore counts throughout the warmer months. Agricultural activity surrounding Erin generates seasonal dust and crop-related particles that infiltrate homes, particularly those near active farmland. Many Erin properties feature horses, hobby farms, and multiple pets, creating ongoing challenges with animal dander and barn-related dust. The community's older homes, particularly those in the historic village core, often have aging ductwork where allergens have accumulated over decades. Gravel roads throughout rural Erin generate dust that enters homes regularly. Residents who chose Erin for its clean country air increasingly recognize that maintaining similar quality indoors requires proper whole-home filtration.

  testimonial: "Country living is wonderful but the dust and pollen were worse than we expected. The air purifier changed everything. We can finally enjoy our rural property without suffering indoors."
