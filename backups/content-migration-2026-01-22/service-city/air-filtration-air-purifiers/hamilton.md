localContext: |
  Hamilton's industrial heritage and unique geography create specific air quality considerations for homeowners throughout the city. The escarpment divides Hamilton, with lower city neighbourhoods historically experiencing more industrial particulate matter from the steel industry along the waterfront. While emissions have improved significantly, many families in areas like Crown Point, Barton Village, and the North End appreciate the extra protection whole-home air filtration provides. Hamilton's older housing stock, particularly the beautiful century homes in Durand and Kirkendall, often contains aging ductwork that accumulates dust and allergens over decades. The mountain neighbourhoods like Ancaster and Stoney Creek enjoy cleaner outdoor air but still face challenges with pollen from abundant green spaces and pet dander from Hamilton's many animal-loving households. Humidity from Lake Ontario can promote mould growth in basements throughout the city.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our century home in Kirkendall always had a musty smell no matter how much we cleaned. The HEPA system finally solved it. The air feels fresh and clean for the first time in years."
