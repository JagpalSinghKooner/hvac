localContext: |
  Fergus homeowners appreciate their community's historic charm along the Grand River, but the area's geography and housing stock create specific indoor air quality challenges. The Grand River valley contributes to elevated humidity levels that can promote mould growth in basements and older homes throughout the community. Fergus's beautiful stone heritage homes and historic downtown buildings feature older construction where decades of dust and allergens have accumulated in aging ductwork systems. The surrounding Wellington County farmland generates seasonal pollen and agricultural dust that infiltrates homes, particularly during spring planting and fall harvest. Many Fergus families embrace outdoor activities and pet ownership, bringing additional allergens into their homes after hiking the Elora Gorge trails or walking through nearby conservation areas. The community's steady growth has attracted young families who prioritize healthy indoor environments for their children.
