localContext: |
  Jerseyville's rural character in the Township of Ancaster provides residents with peaceful country living, but this setting brings indoor air quality considerations unique to agricultural communities. The hamlet's location amidst active farmland means seasonal exposure to crop dust, pollen from fields, and agricultural particles that infiltrate homes throughout the year. Many Jerseyville properties feature larger lots with extensive gardens and landscaping that contribute to elevated pollen counts during growing season. The area's older farmhouses and established homes often have aging HVAC systems where decades of dust and allergens have accumulated. Rural properties regularly experience dust from gravel roads and driveways that enters homes. Many Jerseyville families own horses, livestock, and multiple pets, creating ongoing challenges with animal dander and barn-related particles. Families who chose Jerseyville for its rural tranquility increasingly recognize that proper air filtration helps them enjoy country living without compromising indoor air quality.
