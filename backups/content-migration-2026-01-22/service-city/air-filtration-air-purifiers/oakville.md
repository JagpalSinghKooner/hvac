localContext: |
  Oakville residents expect premium solutions for their homes, and indoor air quality is no exception. The town's beautiful heritage districts like Old Oakville and Bronte feature charming older homes where decades of dust and allergens accumulate in aging ductwork systems. Lake Ontario's influence creates elevated humidity levels that can lead to mould concerns, particularly in basements and crawl spaces throughout the community. Oakville's abundant green spaces and mature tree coverage, while aesthetically pleasing, contribute to high pollen counts that affect allergy sufferers from spring through fall. Many Oakville homes feature multiple pets, with discerning homeowners seeking solutions that address dander without compromising their home's fresh appearance. Newer luxury developments in North Oakville feature tightly sealed construction that can trap cooking odours, VOCs from furnishings, and household chemicals without adequate filtration systems.
