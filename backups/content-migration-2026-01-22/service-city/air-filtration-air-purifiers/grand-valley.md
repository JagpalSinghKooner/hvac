localContext: |
  Grand Valley's rural character and agricultural surroundings create indoor air quality challenges that homeowners often discover after moving to this peaceful Dufferin County community. The village's location amidst active farmland means seasonal exposure to crop dust, pollen, and agricultural particles that infiltrate homes, particularly during spring planting and fall harvest operations. Many Grand Valley properties feature larger lots with extensive landscaping that contributes to elevated pollen counts throughout the growing season. The community's older homes in the village core have aging HVAC systems where dust and allergens have accumulated over decades. Rural properties often face dust from gravel roads and driveways that enters homes regularly. Many Grand Valley residents own horses, hobby farm animals, and multiple pets, creating ongoing challenges with animal dander and barn-related particles. Families who chose Grand Valley for country living increasingly recognize that proper air filtration helps them fully enjoy their rural lifestyle.
