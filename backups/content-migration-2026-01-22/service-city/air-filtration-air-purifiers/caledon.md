localContext: |
  Caledon's rural character and expansive properties bring unique indoor air quality challenges that many homeowners do not anticipate. The town's extensive agricultural lands mean seasonal dust, pollen from crops, and particulates from farming activities regularly infiltrate homes throughout the community. Many Caledon properties feature horses, livestock, and multiple pets, with animal dander becoming a significant concern without proper whole-home filtration. The Niagara Escarpment runs through Caledon, providing beautiful hiking trails and natural areas that unfortunately contribute to elevated pollen and mould spore counts during warmer months. Caledon's larger estate homes often have extensive ductwork systems where dust and allergens accumulate. Gravel driveways and rural roads generate dust that enters homes every time doors open. Many Caledon residents have invested significantly in their properties and understand the value of whole-home air purification for protecting both their family's health and their home's premium finishes.

  testimonial: "With horses on our property and three dogs in the house, air quality was a real challenge. The whole-home HEPA system handles it all beautifully. No more constant dusting and our allergies have vanished."
