localContext: |
  Cambridge residents understand the importance of clean indoor air, especially given the city's industrial heritage and ongoing manufacturing presence. Homes near the Hespeler and Preston industrial corridors can experience particulate matter from nearby facilities, making whole-home filtration particularly valuable. The Grand River runs through Cambridge, and while beautiful, the river valley contributes to higher humidity levels that promote mould growth in basements and older homes throughout Galt and Blair. Many Cambridge families own pets, with dog ownership especially high in newer subdivisions like Southwood and Riverbank, creating ongoing challenges with pet dander accumulation. Older Victorian homes in downtown Galt often have aging ductwork that harbours decades of dust and allergens. Cambridge's mix of historic charm and modern development means air quality solutions need to accommodate a wide variety of home styles and HVAC configurations.
