localContext: |
  Kitchener's diverse housing stock presents varied air quality challenges for homeowners across the city. Established neighbourhoods like Forest Heights and Westmount feature mature trees that produce heavy pollen loads each spring, affecting allergy sufferers throughout the community. The city's rapid growth has brought new construction in areas like Huron Park and Doon South, where off-gassing from building materials, paints, and new furnishings releases volatile organic compounds into indoor air. Downtown Kitchener's older homes and converted lofts often struggle with dust accumulation and inadequate ventilation. Pet ownership is high throughout Kitchener's family-friendly neighbourhoods, with cat and dog dander becoming a persistent issue in homes without proper filtration. The Kitchener-Waterloo region also experiences periodic air quality advisories during summer months, making whole-home air purification an increasingly popular investment for health-conscious families.
