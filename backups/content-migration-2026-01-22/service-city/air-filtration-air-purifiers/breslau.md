localContext: |
  Breslau's transformation from a small village to a thriving community between Kitchener and Guelph brings specific indoor air quality considerations for residents. The area's rapid residential development means many homes are newer construction where off-gassing from building materials, carpets, paints, and new furnishings releases volatile organic compounds into tightly sealed modern homes. Breslau's location surrounded by agricultural land in Woolwich Township means seasonal exposure to farm dust, crop pollen, and agricultural particles that infiltrate homes throughout the community. The Grand River corridor nearby contributes to humidity conditions that can promote mould growth in basements and lower levels. Many Breslau families have young children and pets, creating ongoing concerns about indoor air quality and allergen accumulation. The community's Mennonite heritage means some neighbours still operate farms, contributing to the rural character but also agricultural dust and animal-related allergens in the area.

  testimonial: "Our new home in Breslau had that construction smell for months and dust from nearby farms was constant. The air purifier with activated carbon handled both problems. Finally breathing easy in our new home."
