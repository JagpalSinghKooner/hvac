localContext: |
  Bolton residents enjoy the benefits of small-town living within reach of the GTA, but the community's location brings specific air quality considerations. The Humber River valley creates humidity conditions that can promote mould growth in basements and lower levels throughout Bolton's older neighbourhoods. Industrial areas along Highway 50 can contribute particulates that infiltrate nearby homes, making whole-home filtration particularly valuable for families in those areas. Bolton's mix of established homes and newer developments means varied air quality challenges, from aging ductwork in older properties to off-gassing VOCs in new construction. The surrounding agricultural lands contribute seasonal pollen and dust, especially during spring planting and fall harvest. Many Bolton families have dogs and cats, with pet dander accumulating in homes without adequate filtration. The community's growth has brought young families who prioritize creating healthy indoor environments for their children.
