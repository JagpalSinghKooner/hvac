localContext: |
  Orangeville's small-town charm and natural surroundings create specific indoor air quality considerations for local homeowners. The town sits at the headwaters of the Credit River and Humber River, surrounded by forests and conservation areas that contribute to elevated pollen counts during spring and summer months. Orangeville's established neighbourhoods feature many older homes where dust, mould spores, and allergens have accumulated in ductwork over the years. The surrounding agricultural land means seasonal dust from farming operations can infiltrate homes, particularly during planting and harvest seasons. Many Orangeville families embrace country living with multiple pets and outdoor activities, bringing additional allergens into their homes. The town's location at higher elevation can experience different air quality conditions than surrounding lowlands. Orangeville residents value their community's clean, healthy environment and increasingly seek whole-home solutions to maintain that same quality indoors.
