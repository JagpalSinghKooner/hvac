localContext: |
  Caledon's rural character and larger properties present unique opportunities for heat pump installation, particularly for homes currently using propane or oil heating. Hydro One serves most of Caledon with electrical service capable of supporting heat pump installations. The town's rolling hills and Oak Ridges Moraine location create variable microclimates, with some areas experiencing notably cold winters—our heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure reliable performance across all conditions. Estate properties in the Caledon hills and acreages near Inglewood, Alton, and Cataract often heat with propane, making heat pump conversion extremely cost-effective with savings frequently exceeding 50%. Village centers like Caledon East and Caledon Village feature homes suited for both ducted and ductless systems. Caledon homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The municipality's commitment to preserving rural character aligns with heat pump technology's reduced environmental impact—no fossil fuel combustion means cleaner air and lower carbon emissions throughout the community.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our estate property near Inglewood was expensive to heat with propane. B.A.P designed a heat pump system for our large home that has dramatically reduced our heating costs. We kept the propane backup for extreme cold, but rarely need it—the heat pump handles everything down to -20°C and beyond."
