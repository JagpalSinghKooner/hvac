localContext: |
  Hamilton's dramatic geography—divided between the lower city and the Mountain—creates distinct heating requirements across neighborhoods. Alectra Utilities provides electrical service throughout Hamilton with infrastructure well-suited for heat pump installations. The escarpment creates temperature variations, with Mountain communities like Ancaster, Stoney Creek Mountain, and Upper Centennial experiencing slightly cooler winters than the lower city. Cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C handle Hamilton's entire temperature range reliably. Historic neighborhoods like Westdale, Kirkendall, and Durand feature century homes where ductless systems preserve character while delivering modern efficiency. Newer developments in Binbrook, Waterdown, and east Mountain areas are excellent candidates for ducted systems. Hamilton homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant, plus the city's own sustainability incentives. With Hamilton's mix of older housing stock and new construction, heat pump savings typically range from 30-45% on annual heating costs.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Westdale home near McMaster is over 90 years old. B.A.P designed a heat pump system that works with our existing radiators and added cooling we never had before. The house stays comfortable year-round and our bills are much lower."
