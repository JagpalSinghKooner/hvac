localContext: |
  Jerseyville's rural setting between Ancaster and Brantford presents excellent opportunities for heat pump adoption, particularly for properties currently using propane or oil heating. Hydro One serves Jerseyville and surrounding rural areas with electrical infrastructure capable of supporting heat pump installations. Located in the rolling farmland of Hamilton-Brantford corridor, Jerseyville experiences typical Southern Ontario winters with temperatures reaching -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure reliable operation throughout the season. The village's mix of established farmhouses and newer rural properties benefit from flexible heat pump solutions—ductless for older homes, ducted for newer construction. Many Jerseyville properties rely on propane heating, making heat pump conversion extremely cost-effective with savings often exceeding 50% on annual heating costs. Jerseyville homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. Rural residents appreciate eliminating propane delivery concerns while gaining the bonus of air conditioning for increasingly warm summers.
