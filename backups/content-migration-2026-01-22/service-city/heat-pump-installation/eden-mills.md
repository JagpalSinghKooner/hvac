  Eden Mills' famous commitment to environmental sustainability—as one of Canada's first carbon-neutral communities—makes heat pump technology a natural fit for local homeowners. Guelph Hydro (now Alectra Utilities) serves Eden Mills with electrical infrastructure supporting the community's green energy goals. The village's rural setting along the Eramosa River creates a picturesque environment where homeowners prioritize both comfort and environmental responsibility. Winter temperatures reach -15°C to -20°C, and our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure reliable operation throughout the season. Heritage homes in the village core benefit from ductless systems that preserve architectural character. Rural properties surrounding Eden Mills often heat with propane, making heat pump conversion especially attractive with potential savings exceeding 50%.

For a community that hosts the renowned Writers' Festival and champions carbon neutrality, heat pumps represent the logical choice for clean, efficient home heating.
