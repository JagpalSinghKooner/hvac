localContext: |
  Grand Valley's rural character and growing residential community make it well-suited for heat pump technology, particularly for homes currently using propane or oil heating. Hydro One provides electrical service to Grand Valley and surrounding areas with infrastructure supporting heat pump installations. Located in the Headwaters region at higher elevation, Grand Valley experiences notably cold winters with temperatures regularly dropping below -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C are specifically designed for these demanding conditions. The village center features established homes where ductless systems offer retrofit flexibility. New residential development around the village suits ducted installations. Surrounding rural properties along Highway 25 and concession roads often rely on propane, making heat pump conversion highly attractive with potential savings exceeding 50%. Grand Valley homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community values practical solutions that reduce costs while maintaining comfort through harsh winters—modern cold-climate heat pumps deliver on both counts.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our farmhouse near Grand Valley was expensive to heat with propane. B.A.P recommended a cold-climate heat pump system that has dramatically changed our energy costs. The system handles Grand Valley winters without issue, and we kept propane backup for extreme cold but rarely need it."
