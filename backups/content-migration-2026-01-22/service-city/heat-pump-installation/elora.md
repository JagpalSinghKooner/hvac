localContext: |
  Elora's artistic community and historic limestone architecture create unique considerations for heating system upgrades. Centre Wellington Hydro provides reliable electrical service to Elora, supporting the growing interest in heat pump technology. The Grand River gorge creates a distinctive microclimate, with the village experiencing slightly moderated temperatures compared to surrounding farmland, though winters still bring temperatures below -15°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C handle all conditions reliably. Historic downtown Elora and the heritage district feature irreplaceable stone buildings where ductless mini-splits preserve architectural integrity while delivering modern comfort. Properties along Mill Street and the gorge benefit from the aesthetic flexibility of ductless systems. Newer homes toward Fergus suit ducted installations. Elora homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's commitment to preserving Elora's character while embracing sustainability makes heat pump technology an ideal choice, with typical savings of 35-45% on heating costs.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Preserving our heritage building in Elora while improving comfort was challenging. B.A.P designed a ductless heat pump solution that provides perfect heating and cooling without any exterior or interior impact to our historic home. The energy savings have been substantial."
