localContext: |
  Rockwood's village character and proximity to the Rockwood Conservation Area attract homeowners who appreciate both natural beauty and efficient living. Guelph Hydro (now Alectra Utilities) serves Rockwood with reliable electrical infrastructure supporting heat pump installations. Located just east of Guelph, Rockwood experiences typical Southern Ontario winters with temperatures reaching -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure dependable operation throughout the season. The historic village core features charming older homes where ductless mini-splits provide flexible retrofit options without disrupting heritage character. Properties along Highway 7 and surrounding rural areas often use propane heating, making heat pump conversion particularly attractive. Newer homes in Rockwood's residential areas suit ducted systems well. Rockwood homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's appreciation for the natural environment aligns with heat pump technology's clean operation—no on-site combustion means reduced emissions and a smaller environmental footprint.
