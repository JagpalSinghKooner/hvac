localContext: |
  Cambridge's diverse housing stock—from historic stone homes in Galt to modern builds in Hespeler—makes heat pump selection crucial for optimal performance. Cambridge and North Dumfries Hydro provides reliable electrical service with competitive rates that enhance heat pump economics. The Grand River corridor creates unique microclimates, with riverside properties in Blair and Preston experiencing slightly milder winters than inland areas. Cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure reliable heating throughout Cambridge's variable winter conditions. Heritage homes in Downtown Galt and the Mill Race area often benefit from ductless systems that preserve architectural integrity, while newer subdivisions in South Cambridge and Boxwood are well-suited for central ducted installations. Cambridge homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant, plus potential additional incentives. Average savings of 35-40% on heating costs make heat pumps an excellent investment for Cambridge's mix of century homes and new construction.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We were skeptical about heat pumps working in Cambridge winters, but B.A.P showed us the cold-climate technology. Our heritage home in Preston stays comfortable even at -20°C, and our electricity bills are much lower than our old gas costs."
