localContext: |
  Fergus combines Scottish heritage charm with modern residential growth, creating diverse opportunities for heat pump installation. Centre Wellington Hydro serves Fergus with reliable electrical infrastructure well-suited for heat pump systems. Located along the Grand River in Wellington County, Fergus experiences typical inland Southern Ontario winters with temperatures regularly reaching -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure dependable heating throughout the season. Historic downtown Fergus features beautiful stone buildings and heritage homes where ductless mini-splits offer retrofit solutions that respect architectural character. Newer developments west of town toward Elora and in south Fergus are excellent candidates for ducted systems. Fergus homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's blend of historic preservation and sustainable living makes heat pump technology a natural fit, delivering typical savings of 35-45% on heating costs while reducing environmental impact.
