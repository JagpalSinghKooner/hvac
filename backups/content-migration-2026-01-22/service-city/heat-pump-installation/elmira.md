localContext: |
  Elmira's position as the commercial center of Woolwich Township brings a mix of established homes and newer developments suited for heat pump technology. Waterloo North Hydro serves Elmira with reliable electrical infrastructure supporting residential heat pump installations. Located in the northern part of Waterloo Region, Elmira experiences somewhat colder winters than communities farther south, with temperatures regularly dropping below -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C are specifically designed for these conditions. Downtown Elmira features character homes along Arthur Street where ductless systems offer retrofit flexibility. Growing residential areas on the town's edges suit ducted installations well. Surrounding Mennonite farm country often relies on propane heating, making heat pump conversion attractive for rural properties with savings exceeding 50%. Elmira homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's practical values align with heat pump benefits: reliable performance, lower operating costs, and reduced dependence on fuel deliveries.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Elmira winters can be harsh, so we needed assurance our heat pump would perform. B.A.P installed a cold-climate system that has exceeded expectations—comfortable heating even at -22°C. Our downtown Elmira home has never been more comfortable, and the savings are substantial."
