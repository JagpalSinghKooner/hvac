localContext: |
  Rockwood's village charm along the Eramosa River and its proximity to the Rockwood Conservation Area attract homeowners who appreciate quality construction and efficient heating systems. The historic village centre features stone and brick homes from the 1800s and early 1900s, many with original hydronic boiler systems featuring cast iron radiators. The limestone karst topography that creates the famous Rockwood potholes also influences local water chemistry, leading to hard water challenges for boiler systems. Common Rockwood boiler issues include mineral scale accumulation in heat exchangers, expansion tank waterlogging, and zone valve problems in multi-level heritage homes. Rural properties surrounding the village often have larger boiler installations serving farmhouses and estate properties. The Eramosa River valley creates temperature inversions during winter nights, with cold air settling in low-lying areas. Emergency boiler service is essential for Rockwood residents who depend on reliable heat through Ontario's cold winter months. Our technicians understand both heritage boiler systems and modern high-efficiency equipment serving this historic community.
