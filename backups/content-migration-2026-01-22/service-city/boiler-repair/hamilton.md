localContext: |
  Hamilton's rich industrial heritage has left a legacy of substantial older homes with boiler heating systems throughout neighbourhoods like Westdale, Kirkendall, Durand, and Locke Street South. Many of these properties date from the late 1800s through the 1940s when hot water radiator heat was the premium choice. The escarpment divides Hamilton into distinct microclimates—homes on the Mountain experience colder temperatures and greater heating demands than lower city properties. Common boiler problems in Hamilton include corroded steel piping in older systems, failed pressure reducing valves, and cracked heat exchangers in aging equipment. The city's steel industry heritage means many homes have cast iron radiators and robust boiler installations built to last generations. Hamilton's waterfront redevelopment has also introduced modern condo buildings with high-efficiency condensing boilers requiring specialized service. Emergency boiler repair is crucial when Hamilton's lake-effect weather brings sudden temperature drops and winter storms.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Durand heritage home has a boiler from the 1930s. When it stopped heating the upstairs radiators, B.A.P traced the problem to an airlock and bled the entire system. They also spotted a small leak we had not noticed. Thorough and honest service."
