localContext: |
  Fergus's Scottish heritage and stunning Grand River setting create a community with distinctive housing and heating needs. The historic downtown core—one of the best-preserved 19th-century commercial districts in Ontario—features stone buildings dating to the 1830s, many with upper-floor residential units requiring compact heating solutions. St. Andrew Street and the surrounding heritage district showcase elegant Victorian and Edwardian homes with original architectural details that demand sensitive furnace installations. The established neighbourhoods of Fergus contain housing from every era, from century stone homes to 1970s subdivisions to modern developments. The Grand River gorge creates dramatic microclimates, with riverside properties experiencing cooler, more humid conditions. Newer growth areas toward Elora and along Highway 6 feature contemporary construction with different heating requirements. Centre Wellington Hydro serves Fergus, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebate programs for efficiency upgrades. Fergus's inland location away from Lake Ontario brings continental climate conditions with cold winters and temperature extremes that demand reliable, properly sized heating equipment.

  testimonial: "Our 1870s stone home in downtown Fergus is our pride and joy, but the old furnace was struggling. B.A.P installed a high-efficiency unit without compromising any heritage features. They worked around our stone foundation walls and unusual layout with real craftsmanship."
