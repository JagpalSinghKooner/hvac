localContext: |
  Orangeville's position as Dufferin County's hub and gateway to the Headwaters region creates demanding heating requirements. The historic Broadway corridor features stately brick homes from the 1870s-1920s, many with original architectural details and converted heating systems that require sensitive modernization. Montgomery Village and surrounding 1980s-90s developments contain housing stock now approaching furnace replacement age, with many original mid-efficiency units ready for high-efficiency upgrades. The town's elevation of over 400 metres above sea level—one of the highest in southern Ontario—brings colder winters with temperatures regularly 3-5 degrees below nearby lowland communities. Wind exposure from the surrounding agricultural lands can significantly increase heat loss in poorly insulated homes. The Credit River headwaters create humid conditions requiring careful equipment sizing. Orangeville Hydro serves the community, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with generous rebates for efficiency upgrades. The growing Hansen and Dawson Road areas feature newer construction with tight building envelopes. Rural estate properties surrounding Orangeville often face unique challenges including longer ductwork runs and propane-to-natural-gas conversion opportunities.
