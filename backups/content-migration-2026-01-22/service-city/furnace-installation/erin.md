localContext: |
  Erin's picturesque setting in the Headwaters region presents unique heating challenges shaped by its rural character and elevation. The village centre along Main Street features historic limestone and brick buildings from the 1850s-1900s, many with original architectural features requiring sensitive heating system updates. The surrounding residential areas contain a mix of older village homes and newer subdivisions built to accommodate families seeking small-town living. Hillsburgh, to the north, maintains its own distinct character with heritage homes and newer developments. Erin's position at the headwaters of the Credit River places it among the highest elevations in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, bringing winters that are noticeably colder than communities just 30 minutes south. Many properties outside the village core rely on propane rather than natural gas, requiring specialized equipment knowledge. Hydro One serves the municipality, while Enbridge Gas continues expanding service to previously unconnected areas. The rural properties surrounding Erin—including working farms and estate lots—often feature unique heating requirements including large homes, multiple outbuildings, and long ductwork runs requiring careful system design.

  testimonial: "Living in Erin means real winters, and our propane furnace was costing a fortune. When natural gas came to our street, B.A.P handled the conversion seamlessly. They removed the old propane unit, installed a high-efficiency gas furnace, and coordinated with Enbridge. Our heating costs are down 40%."
