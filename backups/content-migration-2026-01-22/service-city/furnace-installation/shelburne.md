localContext: |
  Shelburne's position as a gateway community between the GTA and Grey-Bruce creates demanding heating requirements reflecting its northern climate. The historic Main Street features Victorian-era commercial buildings from the 1870s-1900s with residential upper floors and converted heating systems. Established residential areas contain a mix of housing from the early 1900s through the 1980s, many with aging furnaces ready for replacement. Shelburne's remarkable growth over the past decade has added substantial new subdivisions on the town's perimeter, featuring modern construction with tight building envelopes requiring right-sized equipment. At over 470 metres elevation, Shelburne is one of the highest communities in southern Ontario, bringing winters that are noticeably colder than the GTA—temperatures can run 5-8 degrees below Toronto, with frequent lake-effect snow from Georgian Bay. Hydro One serves Shelburne, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service to most residential areas. The surrounding rural properties may still rely on propane, requiring specialized equipment knowledge. Wind exposure from the surrounding agricultural lands can significantly increase heat loss, making proper insulation and furnace sizing critical.
