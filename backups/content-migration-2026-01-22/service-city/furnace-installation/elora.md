localContext: |
  Elora's artistic character and spectacular Elora Gorge setting make it one of Ontario's most distinctive communities with unique heating considerations. The village's limestone heritage buildings along Mill Street date to the 1830s-1860s, featuring thick stone walls that hold cold in winter and require powerful, properly sized heating systems. Many downtown properties combine commercial ground floors with residential uppers, demanding flexible HVAC solutions. The surrounding residential areas blend heritage homes from the Victorian era with mid-century builds and newer infill development. The Grand River gorge creates a dramatic microclimate—properties near the river experience cooler temperatures and increased humidity, while those on higher ground face greater wind exposure. Elora's popularity as an arts and tourism destination means some properties serve dual residential-commercial purposes requiring versatile heating solutions. Centre Wellington Hydro serves the community, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebate programs for high-efficiency upgrades. The village's compact layout and heritage preservation requirements demand furnace installations that balance efficiency with sensitivity to architectural character.
