localContext: |
  Bolton, Caledon's largest community, combines small-town heritage with growing suburban development. The historic downtown along Queen Street and King Street features charming Victorian and Edwardian commercial buildings with upper-floor residential units requiring compact heating solutions. The established neighbourhoods surrounding downtown contain a mix of housing from the 1950s through 1980s, many with original furnaces well past their expected lifespan. The South Hill area features 1970s-80s housing with mid-efficiency furnaces ready for replacement. Bolton's significant growth over the past two decades has added extensive new subdivisions along Highway 50 and Coleraine Drive, featuring modern construction with builder-grade equipment often undersized for larger floor plans. The Humber River valley running through Bolton creates microclimates with cooler, more humid conditions near the waterway. Hydro One serves Bolton, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas to most residential areas. Bolton's elevation above the GTA and exposure to weather systems from Georgian Bay can bring colder winters with more snow than nearby Toronto, demanding reliable heating equipment that performs in demanding conditions.

  testimonial: "We bought our Bolton home knowing the furnace was original to the 1970s build. B.A.P provided a thorough assessment, removed the old unit safely, and installed a modern high-efficiency furnace in a single day. The house warms up so much faster now, and it actually reaches the temperature we set."
