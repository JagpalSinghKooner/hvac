localContext: |
  Grand Valley's small-town character and rural setting on the Grand River create distinctive heating needs. The village centre features historic buildings from the late 1800s, including charming commercial properties along Main Street with residential uppers. The established residential areas contain modest homes from various eras, many with original furnaces approaching or past their expected lifespan. Recent growth has added new subdivisions catering to families seeking affordable alternatives to the GTA, featuring modern construction with builder-grade equipment that may need upsizing for proper comfort. Grand Valley's position at the headwaters of the Grand River, at an elevation exceeding 450 metres, brings some of southern Ontario's coldest winters—temperatures regularly run 5-7 degrees below GTA communities. The surrounding agricultural landscape provides beautiful views but also significant wind exposure that increases heat loss. Hydro One serves Grand Valley, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service to the village core—rural properties often rely on propane requiring specialized installation expertise. The Luther Marsh Wildlife Management Area to the north influences local weather patterns, bringing increased humidity and temperature moderation near the wetlands.

  testimonial: "Our Grand Valley home had an oversized older furnace that cycled constantly and never felt comfortable. B.A.P installed a right-sized high-efficiency unit that runs smoothly and actually keeps every room at the temperature we want. The difference in comfort and our gas bills has been dramatic."
