localContext: |
  Eden Mills' reputation as Canada's first carbon-neutral community attracts environmentally conscious residents with high expectations for heating efficiency. This small village on the Eramosa River features charming heritage homes from the 1800s alongside newer properties, with residents committed to sustainability making high-efficiency furnace selection a priority. The historic mill buildings and surrounding homes feature a mix of stone and frame construction with varying heating challenges. Eden Mills' position in the Eramosa River valley creates a sheltered microclimate, though properties on higher ground face more wind exposure. The village's strong environmental ethos—demonstrated through its Going Carbon Neutral initiative—means homeowners are particularly interested in maximizing furnace efficiency and minimizing environmental impact. Many residents choose high-efficiency equipment paired with smart thermostats to optimize energy use. Guelph Hydro (Alectra) serves Eden Mills, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebates that align with the community's sustainability goals. The rural properties surrounding the village often feature larger homes and outbuildings with substantial heating requirements, making proper equipment sizing essential.
