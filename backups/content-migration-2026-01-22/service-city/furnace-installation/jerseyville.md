localContext: |
  Jerseyville's rural character in Brant County presents unique heating challenges requiring specialized expertise. This small hamlet along Highway 52 features a mix of historic farmhouses from the 1800s, mid-century rural homes, and newer country properties. Many original farmhouses have been renovated over generations, creating complex layouts with additions and converted heating systems that require careful assessment. The surrounding agricultural landscape provides beautiful vistas but also significant wind exposure that increases heat loss, particularly in older homes with less insulation. Jerseyville's position between Hamilton and Brantford places it in a transitional climate zone, experiencing weather patterns from both the Lake Ontario moderating influence and continental systems from the interior. Some properties in Jerseyville are served by natural gas through Enbridge, while others rely on propane—requiring specialized equipment knowledge for proper system selection. Hydro One serves this rural community. The working farms and large rural properties often feature multiple outbuildings with heating needs, making comprehensive system design important. Estate properties with substantial square footage require properly calculated heating loads.

  testimonial: "Our farmhouse had been added onto three times over 150 years, creating a heating nightmare. B.A.P took the time to assess each section and designed a system that finally heats the whole house evenly. The original 1860s section is warm for the first time in the twenty years we have owned it."
