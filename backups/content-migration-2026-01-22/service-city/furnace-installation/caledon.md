localContext: |
  Caledon's sprawling rural landscape and distinct village centres create diverse heating challenges requiring specialized expertise. The municipality spans from the Niagara Escarpment to rolling farmland, with significant elevation changes affecting local temperatures. Bolton serves as the primary urban centre with its historic Main Street featuring Victorian-era commercial buildings and surrounding residential areas from various eras. Caledon East and Caledon Village maintain their small-town character with heritage homes alongside newer estate developments. The Palgrave and Albion Hills areas feature luxury rural properties often exceeding 4,000 square feet, requiring carefully calculated heating loads and sometimes multiple-zone systems. Many Caledon properties are not connected to natural gas, relying on propane furnaces that demand specialized installation expertise. Hydro One serves most of Caledon, while Enbridge Gas continues expanding its network into previously unserviced areas—creating opportunities for propane-to-natural-gas conversions. The Oak Ridges Moraine's presence brings environmental considerations and often stricter building requirements. Caledon's elevation and rural exposure mean winter temperatures can run 5-7 degrees colder than Toronto, with significant wind chill factors.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our estate property in Palgrave had an aging propane furnace barely heating our 5,000 square foot home. B.A.P designed a comprehensive solution with two high-efficiency units and proper zoning. Even our sunroom stays warm now, and our propane consumption dropped dramatically."
