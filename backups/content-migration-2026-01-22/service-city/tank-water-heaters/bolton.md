localContext: |
  Bolton has evolved from a rural village to a thriving community while maintaining its distinct character within Caledon. The older areas near downtown Bolton feature homes from the mid-20th century with water heaters often approaching or exceeding their expected lifespan. Newer subdivisions expanding north and west contain modern homes where original water heaters are now reaching replacement age. Bolton's water supply includes both municipal service and private wells depending on location, with well water properties experiencing faster sediment buildup in their tanks. The community's growing population of young families commuting to the GTA requires reliable morning hot water without exception. Bolton residents value straightforward service from contractors who show up when promised and complete work professionally. When your Bolton water heater fails, our technicians respond promptly whether you are in the historic village core or a newer development area.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our water heater started making loud popping noises. B.A.P confirmed it was sediment buildup and replaced the tank before it failed completely. Glad we caught it before we had no hot water."
