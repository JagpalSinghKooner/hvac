localContext: |
  Milton has transformed from a small town to one of Canada's fastest-growing communities, creating diverse water heater service needs. The newer subdivisions in Willmott, Harrison, and Scott feature homes built within the last two decades, though even these relatively new water heaters are approaching replacement age. Milton's older core around Main Street and the historic downtown contains heritage homes with aging infrastructure requiring modernization. The town's groundwater supply contains mineral content that contributes to sediment buildup in tank water heaters over time. Young families relocating to Milton for its excellent schools and community amenities expect reliable home systems. Commuters heading to Toronto via the GO Train cannot start their day with a cold shower. When your Milton water heater fails, our team responds quickly across all neighbourhoods, from Dempsey to Beaty to Old Milton.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Bought our Milton home three years ago and inherited an aging water heater. When it finally failed, B.A.P replaced it within hours. Great to have reliable hot water in our growing family home."
