localContext: |
  Elora's stunning natural beauty and heritage architecture make it one of Ontario's most picturesque villages, but the historic buildings present unique water heater challenges. Stone cottages and heritage homes along the Elora Gorge often have limited basement access and original plumbing configurations requiring careful navigation during water heater replacement. The village's popularity as an arts and tourist destination means bed and breakfasts and rental properties need reliable hot water for guests year-round. Elora's municipal water service covers the village core, while surrounding properties rely on private wells with varying water hardness. The community values preservation and quality—quick fixes are not acceptable in homes that have stood for a century or more. When your water heater fails in Elora, our technicians bring both modern expertise and respect for heritage properties, ensuring installations meet current codes while complementing your home's character.
