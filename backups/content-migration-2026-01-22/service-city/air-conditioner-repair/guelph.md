localContext: |
  Guelph's humid continental climate brings intense summer heat waves that push air conditioning systems to their limits, particularly during July and August when temperatures regularly climb into the high 30s with humidity. The Old University area and downtown core feature many heritage homes from the 1800s that have been retrofitted with central air systems, often requiring specialized repair knowledge for older ductwork configurations. Newer subdivisions in the south end near the Hanlon Expressway and developments around Guelph Lake have modern high-efficiency units that demand technicians certified in current refrigerant standards. The Westminster Woods and Kortright Hills neighbourhoods see high demand for emergency AC repairs during heat waves, especially from families with young children and seniors who cannot safely endure extended periods without cooling. Common issues we address include compressor failures from overworked systems, refrigerant leaks in aging equipment, and frozen evaporator coils caused by restricted airflow in dusty older homes.

  testimonial: "Our AC died during the hottest week of July. B.A.P had a technician at our door within three hours and diagnosed a failed capacitor. He had the part on his truck and we had cold air before dinner. Absolutely lifesaving service."
