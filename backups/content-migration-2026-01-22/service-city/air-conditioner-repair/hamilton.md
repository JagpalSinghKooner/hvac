localContext: |
  Hamilton's unique geography—divided between the lower city and the mountain—creates distinct microclimates that affect air conditioning demand and system wear. The escarpment traps heat in the lower city, making areas like Westdale, Durand, and the North End particularly dependent on reliable AC during summer months. Mountain neighbourhoods in Stoney Creek, Upper Ancaster, and Binbrook experience their own intense heat patterns, with newer construction featuring high-efficiency systems that still struggle during extended heat waves. Hamilton's industrial heritage means many homes in the east end and central mountain were built in the 1950s through 1970s, equipped with aging AC units that frequently require emergency repair or are still running on obsolete R-22 refrigerant. The Locke Street and James Street North corridors feature converted commercial buildings where creative ductwork solutions demand experienced technicians. Our Hamilton team handles everything from seized compressors in Dundas heritage homes to electrical failures in modern Waterdown subdivisions.

  testimonial: "Our AC went out during a brutal heat wave and we have two young kids. B.A.P understood the urgency and had someone on the mountain within two hours. The fan motor had burned out—the technician had a replacement and we were cool again before bedtime. They saved us."
