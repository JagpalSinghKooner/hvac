localContext: |
  Brantford's location along the Grand River creates humid summer conditions that demand effective air conditioning. The downtown core and surrounding areas like West Brant and Holmedale feature older homes with varying levels of existing ductwork and insulation. Eagle Place and Terrace Hill contain working-class neighborhoods with post-war housing stock that often benefits from complete HVAC upgrades alongside AC installation. Growing areas in the north end and developments near Wayne Gretzky Parkway feature newer construction ready for efficient central air systems. The Grand River valley funnels humid air through the city, making proper dehumidification essential for summer comfort. Brantford's affordable housing market attracts young families seeking reliable, efficient cooling systems that won't strain budgets during hot summers.
