localContext: |
  Hamilton's dramatic topography—split between the lower city and the Mountain—creates distinct microclimates affecting AC needs. The lower city, including neighborhoods like Durand, Kirkendall, and Westdale, sits closer to Lake Ontario's moderating influence but experiences intense urban heat island effects during summer. Homes on the Escarpment and Mountain areas like Ancaster, Dundas, and Upper Stoney Creek face slightly cooler nights but still require robust cooling during heat waves. Hamilton's industrial heritage left a housing stock ranging from ornate Victorian mansions in the core to post-war bungalows on the Mountain. The lake effect humidity combines with summer heat to create oppressive conditions that demand properly sized AC systems with excellent dehumidification. Many homeowners upgrading from older, inefficient units discover dramatic improvements in both comfort and energy costs.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Dundas home sits in the valley and the humidity was unbearable every summer. The new high-efficiency system B.A.P installed handles the moisture beautifully—the house finally feels comfortable in August."
