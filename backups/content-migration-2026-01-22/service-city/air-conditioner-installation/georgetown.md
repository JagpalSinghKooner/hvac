localContext: |
  Georgetown serves as Halton Hills' largest community, combining historic charm with significant residential growth. The downtown core along Main Street features heritage buildings and Victorian homes where AC installation requires careful integration with older construction. Established neighborhoods like Park and Delrex contain well-maintained homes from various eras with differing ductwork conditions. Rapidly expanding areas in north Georgetown and developments near the GO station feature modern construction built to current energy standards. The Credit River flows through town, contributing humidity that intensifies summer heat. Georgetown's commuter population seeks efficient, reliable cooling systems that maintain home comfort with minimal attention required during busy weekday schedules.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We moved to Georgetown for the small-town feel but our summers were brutal. B.A.P installed a high-efficiency system that keeps our Victorian cool while running so quietly we barely notice it. The energy savings have been substantial."
