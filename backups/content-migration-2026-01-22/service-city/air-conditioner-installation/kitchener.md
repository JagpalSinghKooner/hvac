localContext: |
  Kitchener's summers bring persistent heat and humidity that challenge homes across the city's varied neighborhoods. The central core around Victoria Park and Civic District features early 20th-century homes with plaster walls and limited attic space, requiring creative installation solutions. Established suburbs like Forest Heights and Stanley Park have mid-century homes where aging ductwork may need updating alongside new AC installation. Rapidly growing areas like Doon South, Huron Park, and developments near the Fairway Road corridor feature modern construction ready for high-efficiency systems. The city's position in the Grand River watershed contributes to humid conditions that make proper AC sizing critical—undersized units struggle with moisture removal while oversized systems short-cycle. Kitchener homeowners benefit from variable-speed technology that maintains consistent comfort and humidity control throughout summer's hottest stretches.

  testimonial: "Our Forest Heights bungalow had the original 1960s ductwork. B.A.P recommended upgrading the ducts alongside our new AC, and the improvement in airflow and cooling has been dramatic. Every room stays comfortable now."
