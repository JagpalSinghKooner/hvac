localContext: |
  Shelburne's position at the top of the Niagara Escarpment provides slightly cooler average temperatures than lower elevations, but summers still bring heat requiring reliable air conditioning. The town's main street features heritage commercial buildings with upper-floor residences where AC installation demands creative approaches. Established residential areas contain modest homes from various eras with differing ductwork and insulation conditions. Newer subdivisions expanding the town's boundaries offer modern construction suited for efficient central air systems. Shelburne's agricultural surroundings mean less urban heat island effect but greater sun exposure. The town's growing population of young families commuting to the GTA seeks affordable, reliable cooling solutions that provide comfort without excessive operating costs.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We were nervous about affording AC for our Shelburne home, but B.A.P helped us find an efficient system within our budget. It's been three summers and our electricity bills are completely manageable even during heat waves."
