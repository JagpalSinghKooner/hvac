localContext: |
  Rockwood is a charming village in Guelph-Eramosa Township, known for its natural beauty and the iconic Rockwood Conservation Area. Summer visitors flock to the area for camping and outdoor recreation, while residents depend on well-maintained air conditioning to stay comfortable during warm, humid months. The village features a mix of historic stone homes in the core, established residences from mid-century development, and newer construction on the outskirts. Many AC systems in Rockwood date from the 1990s renovation wave when central air became standard in the area, making these units prime candidates for careful annual maintenance. The Eramosa River valley location can trap humid air during summer heat waves, increasing cooling demands. Properties near the conservation area often have outdoor units exposed to forest debris and high pollen levels from surrounding natural areas. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance by mid-April, before summer activities begin. Common findings include coils clogged with natural debris and limestone water deposits on system components.
