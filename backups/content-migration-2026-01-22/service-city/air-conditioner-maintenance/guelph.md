localContext: |
  Guelph summers bring humid conditions with temperatures regularly climbing into the high 20s and low 30s from June through August. The Speed River valley location creates unique microclimate patterns that can stress cooling systems, particularly in older homes throughout the Ward and St. Patrick's Ward neighbourhoods. Many properties in South End and Exhibition Park feature AC units installed during the building boom of the early 2000s, meaning these systems are now approaching 20 years of service and require diligent maintenance to continue performing efficiently. We recommend scheduling spring tune-ups by mid-April before the University of Guelph graduation season, when many homeowners are preparing for family visits. Common maintenance findings in Guelph include cottonwood seed buildup in condenser coils and limestone-related drain line issues from the local water supply.

  testimonial: "Scheduled our AC tune-up in early April and they found a failing capacitor. Fixed it on the spot before summer hit. Great preventive service."
