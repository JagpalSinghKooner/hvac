localContext: |
  Elora's picturesque setting along the Grand River gorge makes it one of Ontario's most charming villages, with unique AC maintenance considerations for homeowners. The historic downtown features beautifully preserved 19th-century stone buildings where modern cooling systems have been carefully retrofitted, requiring specialized attention to maintain both comfort and heritage character. Residential areas beyond the core include a mix of century homes and more recent construction, with varied equipment ages and types. Summer in Elora brings warm temperatures and humidity typical of the Grand River valley, with the gorge creating microclimates that can affect cooling patterns. Many AC systems in the area date from renovations done in the 1990s and early 2000s when tourism began driving property improvements. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance in early April, well before the busy tourist season and summer art shows. Common findings include condenser units affected by the area's mature tree canopy, and drain line issues from limestone-rich well water common throughout the region.
