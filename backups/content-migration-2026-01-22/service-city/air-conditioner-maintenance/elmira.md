localContext: |
  Elmira is the largest community in Woolwich Township, known for its strong agricultural heritage and the famous Elmira Maple Syrup Festival. Summer months bring warm, humid weather that makes reliable air conditioning essential for home comfort. The town features a mix of historic properties near the downtown core along Arthur Street, established neighbourhoods from mid-century development, and newer subdivisions that have expanded the community in recent decades. Many homes in central Elmira have AC systems from the 1990s and early 2000s that are now reaching the 20-25 year mark, where diligent maintenance is critical to continued reliability. The agricultural surroundings mean outdoor condenser units are exposed to crop dust, pollen, and debris throughout the growing season, particularly during summer harvest activities. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance in early April, well before the busy summer months. Common findings include heavily soiled condenser coils from agricultural dust, and hard water deposits from well water affecting evaporator coils and drain lines.

  testimonial: "Living in farm country means our AC works hard filtering dusty air. Annual maintenance keeps the system clean and our home comfortable."
