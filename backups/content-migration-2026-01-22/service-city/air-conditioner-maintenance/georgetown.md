localContext: |
  Georgetown is the largest community in Halton Hills, offering a blend of small-town charm and modern amenities that attracts families and professionals alike. Summer months bring warm, humid conditions typical of the region, with temperatures regularly climbing into the high 20s and low 30s from June through August. The town features diverse neighbourhoods ranging from heritage properties near downtown and along Main Street to established areas in Delrex, and newer developments in Cedarvale and the Armstrong corridor. Many homes built during Georgetown's growth periods in the 1980s and 1990s have AC systems that are now 25-30 years old, making regular maintenance critical for continued reliability. The Credit River valley location adds humidity during summer months, while mature trees throughout established neighbourhoods contribute debris that can clog condenser units. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance by early April, before GO Transit commuters turn their attention to summer activities. Common findings include aging capacitors and contactors in older systems, and cottonwood seed accumulation in condensers.
