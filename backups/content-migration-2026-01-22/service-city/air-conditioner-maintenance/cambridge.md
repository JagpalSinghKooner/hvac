localContext: |
  Cambridge experiences warm, humid summers typical of the Grand River valley, with July and August temperatures frequently exceeding 30 degrees Celsius. The city's three distinct cores—Galt, Preston, and Hespeler—each present different AC maintenance considerations. Heritage homes in downtown Galt often have retrofitted central air systems that require careful attention to ductwork and airflow balance. Preston's post-war residential areas feature many units from the 1990s replacement cycle, while newer developments in Hespeler and along the Blair Road corridor have modern high-efficiency systems. We recommend Cambridge residents schedule maintenance in late March or early April, before the spring rush and well ahead of the first heat waves. Our technicians frequently find issues with outdoor units affected by road salt spray in areas near Highway 401, and cottonwood debris is common across all three cores.
