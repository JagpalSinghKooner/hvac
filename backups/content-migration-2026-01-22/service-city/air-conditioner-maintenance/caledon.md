localContext: |
  Caledon's sprawling rural landscape encompasses everything from village centres to estate properties and working farms, each presenting unique AC maintenance requirements. Communities like Caledon Village, Caledon East, and Inglewood feature a mix of newer subdivisions and established homes with varied equipment ages. The town's elevation on the Niagara Escarpment can moderate summer temperatures, but July and August still bring stretches of heat and humidity that require reliable cooling systems. Many larger rural properties have high-capacity AC units serving substantial homes, where efficiency losses from poor maintenance translate to significant energy costs. Estate properties along the Escarpment and in areas like Belfountain often have premium equipment requiring manufacturer-specific service protocols. We recommend scheduling maintenance in early spring before the agricultural season increases airborne dust and debris. Common findings include condenser units clogged with rural particulates and systems undersized for homes that have been expanded over the years.
