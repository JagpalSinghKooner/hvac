localContext: |
  Brantford's location along the Grand River valley brings hot, humid summers that make reliable air conditioning essential for home comfort. The city's historic neighbourhoods like Eagle Place and West Brant feature many century homes with retrofitted central air systems that require specialized maintenance attention. Newer developments in areas like Shellard Lane and the north end have modern high-efficiency equipment with different service requirements. Summer temperatures in Brantford frequently exceed 30 degrees Celsius, with humidity levels that make effective cooling crucial from June through September. Many homes throughout the city have AC systems dating from the 1990s and early 2000s, approaching or exceeding typical service life. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance in late March or early April, before the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre summer programs begin and families turn attention to activities. Common findings include hard water scale buildup and older thermostats that reduce system efficiency.
