localContext: |
  Acton is a historic community within Halton Hills, known for its leather manufacturing heritage and charming small-town character. Summer months bring warm, humid conditions that make reliable air conditioning important for home comfort. The town features a mix of historic properties near the downtown core along Mill Street, established mid-century neighbourhoods, and newer residential development on the outskirts. Many homes in central Acton have AC systems retrofitted into older buildings during renovations in the 1990s and 2000s, requiring careful attention to ductwork and system balance. Fairy Lake and the surrounding natural areas add humidity to summer conditions while contributing organic debris that can affect outdoor units. Properties throughout Acton may also be affected by agricultural dust from surrounding farmland during growing season. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance in early April, before the Leathertown Festival and summer activities begin. Common findings include condensers clogged with cottonwood seeds and leaves, and aging components in systems approaching the 20-year service mark.
