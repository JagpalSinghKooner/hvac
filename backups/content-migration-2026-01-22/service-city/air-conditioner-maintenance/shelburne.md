localContext: |
  Shelburne sits at the northern edge of Dufferin County, where the rolling hills and agricultural landscape create a distinct summer climate. While slightly cooler than communities further south, July and August still bring periods of significant heat and humidity that demand reliable air conditioning. The town has experienced steady growth in recent years, with new subdivisions on the south and east sides featuring modern AC equipment, while established homes near downtown and along Owen Sound Street often have systems dating from the 1990s and early 2000s. Rural properties surrounding Shelburne typically have larger homes with higher cooling demands and outdoor units exposed to farm dust and debris. Many residents commute to larger centres, making reliable home comfort after long workdays especially important. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance by mid-April, before the agricultural season increases airborne particulates. Common findings include heavily soiled condenser coils from rural dust, and systems struggling with the cooling demands of older, less insulated homes.
