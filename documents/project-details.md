# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Project: Local HVAC SEO Website

---

## 1. Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a **high-performing, SEO-first website for a local HVAC company** that:

- Ranks strongly in local organic search
- Converts qualified visitors into booked service calls
- Builds trust and credibility with homeowners and commercial customers
- Scales cleanly as services, locations, and content expand

The website is a **core revenue channel**, not a brochure.

---

## 2. Business Objectives

1. Dominate local search results for HVAC services in target service areas  
2. Generate consistent, qualified inbound leads (calls, forms, bookings)  
3. Clearly communicate services, service areas, and trust signals  
4. Support long-term SEO growth without repeated site rebuilds  
5. Enable rapid creation of new service and location pages without technical debt  

---

## 3. Target Audience

### Primary Audience
- Homeowners seeking HVAC installation, repair, or maintenance
- Property managers and small commercial clients
- Users with high intent (problem-aware, ready to book)

### Secondary Audience
- Search engines and AI search systems (Google, Maps, AI summaries)
- Internal marketing and operations teams maintaining the site

The site must prioritise **clarity, trust, and speed to action**.

---

## 4. Core Success Metrics

- Organic traffic growth (local + service keywords)
- Google Business Profile interaction uplift
- Conversion rate (calls, form submissions, bookings)
- Coverage of service + location keyword combinations
- Page indexation and crawl efficiency
- Time to publish new SEO pages

---

## 5. SEO Strategy (High Level)

The website must be designed from the ground up to support:

- Service-based SEO (e.g. furnace installation, AC repair, heat pumps)
- Location-based SEO (cities, regions, neighbourhoods)
- Service-location combinations at scale
- Supporting informational content (blogs, FAQs, seasonal pages)

SEO is driven by **structure and consistency**, not one-off optimisation.

---

## 6. URL & Page Structure Philosophy

The site must support **clear, predictable, and scalable URLs**, including:

- Core service pages
- Location pages
- Service-by-location pages
- Supporting content (blog, FAQs, reviews)

Principles:
- One canonical URL per page
- Human-readable, keyword-aligned slugs
- No duplicate or competing URLs
- URL patterns that scale without special-case logic

Once defined, URL structures should remain stable long term.

---

## 7. Content Strategy (System Level)

Content is treated as **structured, reusable data**.

- Services, locations, and service-location combinations are first-class entities
- Content must be easy to expand without changing site architecture
- Business-critical information is never hardcoded into templates
- Content updates should not require code changes

This enables SEO growth without developer bottlenecks.

---

## 8. Trust & Conversion Requirements

The site must clearly communicate trust and legitimacy, including:

- Reviews and ratings
- Certifications, licences, and guarantees
- Clear service explanations
- Strong calls to action
- Easy contact and booking pathways

Conversion is supported through **clarity and confidence**, not aggressive tactics.

---

## 9. Technical Principles (High Level)

The platform should:

- Be fast, lightweight, and SEO-friendly
- Prefer static rendering where possible
- Minimise unnecessary JavaScript
- Be easy to maintain and extend
- Avoid framework lock-in through clean architecture

Technology choices must support SEO, performance, and long-term maintainability.

---

## 10. UI & Design Principles (Business-Driven)

Design decisions should:

- Reinforce trust and professionalism
- Support scanning and readability
- Highlight primary conversion actions
- Remain consistent across all pages

Visual polish matters, but **clarity and usability matter more**.

---

## 11. Scalability Requirements

The system must support:

- Adding new services without rework
- Adding new service areas at scale
- Expanding content volume significantly
- Iterating on design without structural changes

The site should scale in **content size and SEO reach**, not complexity.

---

## 12. Non-Goals

This project does not aim to:

- Act as a full marketing automation platform
- Replace CRM or booking software
- Serve as a general CMS for unrelated content
- Optimise for experimental design trends

The focus is **local SEO performance and lead generation**.

---

## 13. Long-Term Vision

The website should become:

- The primary acquisition channel for the HVAC business
- A defensible SEO asset in competitive local markets
- A platform that compounds value over time

Every decision should support long-term visibility, trust, and conversion.

---

## 14. Guiding Principle

> Build a website that search engines understand, users trust, and the business can grow with.
