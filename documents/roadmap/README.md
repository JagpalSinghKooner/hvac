## Key Principles

> Each phase should reduce ambiguity, not introduce it.
> Progress is measured by **stability and clarity**, not speed.

### Phase 6 Specific Principles

1. **Lead Generation First**: Every component should support conversion goals
2. **Mobile-First**: Most HVAC searches are on mobile devices
3. **Trust Signals**: Local customers need credibility indicators
4. **Schema Early**: Add structured data as you build components, don't wait for Phase 7
5. **Professional Polish**: This is when the site looks like a real business
