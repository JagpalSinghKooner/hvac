problems:
  - title: 'Stuffy, Stale Indoor Air'
    description: 'Modern energy-efficient homes are sealed tight—great for heating bills, terrible for air quality. Without mechanical ventilation, cooking odors, VOCs from furniture, and CO2 from breathing accumulate. You notice it as that "closed-up" smell.'
    icon: 'air'
  - title: 'Moisture and Condensation Problems'
    description: 'Showers, cooking, and breathing add moisture to your home. In winter, that moisture condenses on cold windows and can grow mold in walls. Airtight homes without proper ventilation trap this moisture inside.'

  - title: 'Opening Windows Wastes Energy'
    description: 'The old solution—open a window—sends your expensive heated or cooled air straight outside. In Ontario winters, that is not practical. You need fresh air without sacrificing comfort or energy efficiency.'

approach:
  headline: 'Balanced Ventilation with Heat Recovery'
  description: 'HRV and ERV systems continuously exchange stale indoor air for fresh outdoor air—but recover 70-80% of the heat energy in the process. Your home gets fresh air without the energy penalty of opening windows. HRVs transfer heat only; ERVs also transfer moisture, making them ideal for controlling winter humidity.'
