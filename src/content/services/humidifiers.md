problem:
  headline: 'Ontario Winters Create Desert-Like Indoor Conditions'
  description: 'Ontario winters drop indoor humidity to 15-20%—desert-like conditions that affect your health and home. You wake up with dry throat, cracked lips, and itchy skin. Static shocks are constant throughout the day. Respiratory irritation increases your susceptibility to colds and flu. Meanwhile, dry air shrinks wood, causing hardwood floors to develop gaps, furniture joints to loosen, and wood trim to pull away from walls. Musical instruments go out of tune, and wallpaper peels at the edges. Portable humidifiers cannot keep up—they need constant refilling, only help one room, and become breeding grounds for mold if not cleaned constantly. The damage and discomfort accumulate every winter.'
