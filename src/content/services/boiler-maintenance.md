problem:
  headline: 'Keeping Your Boiler Running Safely and Efficiently'
  description: 'Boilers fail when you need them most—during the coldest weather when they work hardest. A breakdown in January means emergency service calls, frozen pipes risk, and uncomfortable nights. Scale buildup, dirty burners, and sediment accumulation force your boiler to work harder, raising fuel bills 15-25% higher than they should be. Improper combustion can produce deadly carbon monoxide—annual inspection ensures your boiler burns cleanly and vents properly.'

    - 'Mid-winter boiler failures during the coldest weather'
    - 'Gradual efficiency loss from scale buildup and dirty burners'
