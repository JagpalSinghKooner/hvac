problem:
  headline: 'When Your Water Heater Fails, Hot Water Cannot Wait'
  description: 'A failed water heater disrupts your entire household. Cold showers, no hot water for dishes or laundry, no ability to clean properly. Most tanks fail suddenly—often after 10-15 years of reliable service. Warning signs like rusty water, rumbling noises, or small leaks indicate internal corrosion and imminent failure. When water pools around your tank, it is a matter of hours or days before catastrophic failure damages your home. Replacement on your schedule is far better than emergency situations at premium prices.'

    - 'Complete loss of hot water disrupts household routines and comfort'
    - 'Rusty water or loud rumbling indicates internal tank corrosion'
    - 'Visible leaks signal imminent catastrophic failure and potential flooding'
