## Professional Cooling Solutions for Southern Ontario

Southern Ontario summers demand reliable air conditioning. At B.A.P Heating & Cooling Services Ltd, we've been installing and servicing cooling systems since 1994, helping homeowners maintain comfortable indoor environments even during the hottest months.

### Comprehensive Cooling Services

We provide complete cooling solutions for residential and commercial properties throughout Southern Ontario. Our services include central air conditioning installation, ductless mini-split systems, heat pump cooling, commercial HVAC, air conditioning repair, and preventive maintenance programs.

Our approach focuses on proper system sizing, quality installation, and long-term reliability. We don't oversell capacity or recommend unnecessary features. Instead, we evaluate your space, consider your cooling needs, and recommend systems designed to perform efficiently for years.

### Air Conditioning Installation

A properly installed air conditioning system delivers consistent comfort and efficient operation. Our installation process begins with detailed load calculations to determine the precise cooling capacity your space requires. We assess your home's insulation, window placement, sun exposure, and existing ductwork to ensure optimal system performance.

We install high-efficiency central air conditioners, ductless mini-split systems, and heat pumps that provide both heating and cooling. Our technicians work with premium manufacturers including Carrier, Lennox, and Trane—brands we trust for reliability and performance in Southern Ontario's climate.

Every installation includes proper refrigerant charging, airflow verification, and thorough testing to ensure your system operates at peak efficiency. We take the time to do it right, because a well-installed system performs better and lasts longer.

### Ductless Mini-Split Systems

Ductless systems offer an excellent solution for homes without existing ductwork, additions, and spaces where zoned cooling makes sense. These systems provide quiet, efficient cooling with the flexibility to control temperatures in individual rooms or zones.

We design and install ductless systems that match your cooling needs without over-engineering the solution. Our team handles the indoor unit placement, outdoor compressor installation, and line set routing with attention to both functionality and aesthetics.

### Air Conditioning Repair and Maintenance

When your air conditioning fails on a hot summer day, you need responsive, competent service. Our technicians diagnose cooling problems accurately and explain repair options clearly. We maintain a comprehensive parts inventory and can source specialized components quickly when needed.

Regular maintenance prevents many cooling failures and keeps your system running efficiently. Our maintenance programs include coil cleaning, refrigerant level checks, electrical connection inspection, airflow verification, and comprehensive system testing. Preventive maintenance extends equipment life and reduces the likelihood of inconvenient breakdowns.

### Energy Efficiency and Comfort

Modern air conditioning technology delivers remarkable improvements in both efficiency and comfort. High-efficiency systems reduce cooling costs while providing better humidity control and more consistent temperatures throughout your home.

We help you understand the efficiency ratings that matter—SEER ratings, Energy Star certification, and expected operating costs. More importantly, we help you evaluate whether a higher-efficiency system makes financial sense for your specific situation.

### Rebates and Incentives

Various rebate programs can significantly offset the cost of air conditioning upgrades. We stay current with available incentives including the Canada Greener Homes Grant, utility company rebates, and manufacturer promotions. Our team handles the rebate paperwork, ensuring you receive all available benefits without administrative complexity.
