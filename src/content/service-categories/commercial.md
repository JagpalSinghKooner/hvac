## Commercial HVAC Solutions for Southern Ontario Businesses

Your building's HVAC system is critical to your business operations, employee comfort, and customer experience. At B.A.P Heating & Cooling Services Ltd, we've been providing commercial HVAC services to Southern Ontario businesses since 1994, delivering reliable solutions backed by technical expertise and responsive service.

### Comprehensive Commercial HVAC Services

We provide complete HVAC solutions for commercial properties throughout Southern Ontario. Our services include rooftop unit installation and service, commercial split systems, ventilation solutions, refrigeration services, preventive maintenance programs, and emergency repair service.

Our approach focuses on minimizing downtime, maintaining comfortable indoor environments, and extending equipment life through proper installation and regular maintenance. We understand that HVAC failures disrupt your business, and we prioritize responsive, competent service that gets your systems back online quickly.

### Rooftop Units (RTUs)

Rooftop HVAC units are the workhorses of commercial climate control, providing efficient heating and cooling in a single, self-contained package. We install, service, and maintain rooftop units for a wide range of commercial applications including retail spaces, offices, warehouses, restaurants, and light industrial facilities.

Our technicians have extensive experience with major commercial equipment manufacturers. We handle capacity planning, equipment selection, crane placement, electrical and gas connections, and startup commissioning. When it's time for replacement, we coordinate the entire process to minimize business disruption.

Regular rooftop unit maintenance prevents costly failures and maintains efficiency. Our commercial maintenance programs include filter changes, coil cleaning, refrigerant checks, electrical connection inspection, and comprehensive system testing.

### Commercial Split Systems

For buildings where rooftop placement isn't practical, we design and install commercial split systems that provide reliable climate control with flexible equipment placement. These systems separate the condensing unit from the air handler, allowing for installation configurations that work with your building's layout.

We size and install split systems for offices, retail spaces, restaurants, and mixed-use buildings. Our installations include proper refrigerant line routing, condensate management, and control system integration.

### Ventilation and Make-Up Air

Commercial properties often require ventilation solutions beyond what residential systems need. Cooking equipment, manufacturing processes, and high-occupancy spaces demand proper ventilation to maintain air quality and meet building codes.

We design and install make-up air systems that replace exhausted air without creating negative pressure issues. Our ventilation solutions integrate with your heating and cooling systems to maintain comfort while providing the fresh air your space requires.

### Commercial Refrigeration Support

Many businesses need refrigeration solutions beyond traditional HVAC. While refrigeration isn't our primary focus, we provide support for walk-in coolers, freezers, and refrigerated display cases commonly found in restaurants, convenience stores, and food service operations.

### Preventive Maintenance Programs

Commercial HVAC equipment operates under demanding conditions. Regular maintenance prevents failures, maintains efficiency, and extends equipment life. Our commercial maintenance programs include scheduled service visits, comprehensive inspections, filter changes, cleaning, and priority emergency service.

We work with you to schedule maintenance during off-hours to minimize business disruption. Our technicians document all service work, maintaining detailed records of your equipment's condition and service history.

### Emergency Service

When commercial HVAC equipment fails, you need fast, competent response. Our emergency service gets technicians on-site quickly to diagnose problems and implement solutions. We maintain an inventory of common commercial parts and can source specialized components rapidly when needed.

### Energy Efficiency and Operating Costs

Commercial HVAC represents a significant portion of building operating costs. Modern high-efficiency equipment can reduce energy consumption substantially while providing better comfort control. We help you evaluate the payback period for efficiency upgrades and identify opportunities to reduce operating costs.

Variable speed technology, economizer operation, and advanced controls can all contribute to energy savings. We design systems that balance initial cost with long-term operating efficiency.

### Planned Equipment Replacement

Commercial HVAC equipment doesn't last forever. We help building owners and managers plan for replacement before failures occur, allowing for budgeting and scheduled installation that minimizes business disruption. Our assessment includes equipment age, condition, efficiency, and repair history to recommend optimal replacement timing.
