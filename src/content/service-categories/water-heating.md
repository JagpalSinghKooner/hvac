## Reliable Water Heating Solutions for Southern Ontario Homes

Dependable hot water is essential for your family's daily comfort. At B.A.P Heating & Cooling Services Ltd, we've been installing and servicing water heating systems since 1994, providing Southern Ontario homeowners with reliable solutions that deliver hot water efficiently and economically.

### Comprehensive Water Heating Services

We provide complete water heating solutions for residential properties throughout Southern Ontario. Our services include tankless water heater installation, traditional tank water heaters, high-efficiency systems, water heater repair, and preventive maintenance programs.

Our approach focuses on matching the right water heating system to your household's needs. We consider your hot water usage patterns, available fuel sources, space constraints, and budget to recommend solutions that will perform reliably for years.

### Tankless Water Heater Installation

Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand without the standby energy loss of traditional tanks. These systems heat water as it flows through the unit, delivering an endless supply of hot water while using less energy than conventional systems.

We install natural gas and electric tankless systems sized appropriately for your home's hot water demand. Proper sizing is critical—an undersized tankless heater won't keep up with demand, while an oversized unit wastes money on unnecessary capacity. Our technicians calculate your peak hot water needs and recommend systems that will perform reliably during your household's highest-demand periods.

Tankless installation requires proper venting, gas line sizing, and electrical connections. We handle all aspects of installation, ensuring your system operates safely and efficiently from day one.

### Traditional Tank Water Heaters

Tank-style water heaters remain an excellent choice for many homes, offering reliable hot water delivery at a lower initial cost than tankless systems. Modern high-efficiency tank heaters provide significantly better performance than older models while maintaining the simplicity and reliability homeowners appreciate.

We install natural gas, electric, and power-vented tank water heaters in sizes from 40 to 80 gallons. Our installations include proper venting, code-compliant connections, and thorough testing to ensure safe, reliable operation.

### High-Efficiency Water Heating

Modern water heating technology delivers remarkable efficiency improvements. Condensing tankless heaters and high-efficiency tank systems can reduce your water heating costs by 30% or more compared to older equipment.

We help you understand the efficiency ratings that matter—Uniform Energy Factor (UEF) for tank systems and Energy Factor (EF) for tankless units. More importantly, we help you determine whether the additional cost of higher-efficiency equipment makes sense for your specific situation.

### Water Heater Repair and Maintenance

When your water heater fails, you need fast, competent service. Our technicians diagnose water heating problems accurately and explain your repair options clearly. Common repairs include thermostat replacement, heating element replacement, pressure relief valve service, and gas valve replacement.

Sometimes repair doesn't make economic sense. When your water heater is approaching the end of its service life or requires expensive repairs, we provide honest guidance on whether replacement is the better choice.

Regular maintenance extends water heater life and maintains efficiency. Our maintenance service includes inspection of safety components, anode rod assessment, sediment flushing for tank systems, and comprehensive performance testing.

### Energy Efficiency and Rebates

Water heating typically accounts for 15-20% of your home's energy costs. Upgrading to a high-efficiency system can deliver significant savings while providing better hot water performance. Various rebate programs can help offset the cost of efficiency upgrades.

We stay current with available incentives including the Canada Greener Homes Grant, utility company rebates, and manufacturer promotions. Our team handles the rebate paperwork, ensuring you receive all available benefits.

### Fuel Options and Conversion

We work with all fuel types common in Southern Ontario—natural gas, propane, and electricity. If you're considering fuel conversion, we can evaluate the costs and benefits of different options for your situation.

Natural gas typically offers the lowest operating cost where it's available. Propane provides an alternative in areas without natural gas service. Electric water heaters work well in certain applications and may be required in all-electric homes.
