# Maintenance Plans

An HVAC system represents a significant investment in your home's comfort and value. Like any major investment, it requires regular attention to perform reliably and last its full lifespan. That's where preventive maintenance becomes essential—not as an expense, but as protection.

## The Cost of Deferred Maintenance

Homeowners who skip regular maintenance often face consequences that go beyond discomfort. A furnace that stops working on the coldest night of the year. An air conditioner that fails during a summer heatwave. Emergency service calls that cost three to five times more than scheduled maintenance. Equipment that wears out years before it should, requiring premature replacement.

These scenarios aren't hypothetical. After three decades serving Southern Ontario, we've responded to countless emergency calls that could have been prevented with routine maintenance. The pattern is consistent: systems that receive regular attention rarely fail unexpectedly.

## Preventive Maintenance That Matters

Our maintenance plans take the burden of scheduling and remembering off your shoulders. Once enrolled, your system receives attention on a schedule that makes sense—typically twice per year for most equipment. We inspect, clean, test, and tune each component to manufacturer specifications.

This isn't a quick visual inspection. Our technicians follow comprehensive checklists developed over 30+ years of field experience. We identify worn parts before they fail. We adjust settings that drift over time. We catch small issues before they cascade into major problems.

Members receive priority scheduling for service calls and discounted rates on any repairs that become necessary. When you need us, you move to the front of the line.

## Peace of Mind Over Time

The value of a maintenance plan compounds over years. Your system runs more efficiently, reducing monthly energy costs. Components last longer because they're not working under strain from dirty filters or misaligned calibrations. You avoid the stress and expense of emergency breakdowns.

Perhaps most importantly, you gain the peace of mind that comes from knowing your home's comfort systems are professionally maintained. No wondering if you've forgotten something. No scrambling to find a technician when equipment fails at the worst possible moment.

## Plans Built for Your Equipment

We offer maintenance plans sized to match your specific equipment:

**Single System Plans** cover one piece of equipment—a furnace, air conditioner, boiler, or heat pump. Ideal for homeowners who've recently replaced one system but have another that needs attention.

**Whole-Home Plans** cover both your heating and cooling systems under one plan, providing complete HVAC maintenance year-round. This is our most popular option for homeowners who want comprehensive protection.

**Custom Plans** can be designed for properties with specialized equipment—multiple zones, commercial-grade systems, or unique configurations that need tailored attention.

## What's Included

Every maintenance visit includes thorough inspection and servicing of your system:

- Complete visual inspection of all system components
- Filter replacement or cleaning (filters provided)
- Cleaning of key components (coils, burners, blowers)
- Testing and calibration of thermostats and controls
- Measurement of system performance metrics
- Lubrication of motors and moving parts where applicable
- Inspection of electrical connections and safety controls
- Flue and venting inspection for combustion equipment
- Detailed report of findings and recommendations

If we identify any issues during a maintenance visit, you'll receive a clear explanation and upfront pricing for any recommended repairs. As a plan member, you receive discounted rates on all repair work.

## The B.A.P Difference

Our maintenance plans aren't just about checking boxes on a form. They're about accountability. When you enroll, you're working with the same company that will be here next year, and the year after. We're locally owned, established in 1994, with deep roots in Southern Ontario communities.

Your maintenance visits are performed by experienced, licensed technicians—the same professionals who handle complex installations and repairs. They know what to look for because they've seen what happens when maintenance is neglected.

Plans are transferable if you sell your home, adding documented value to your property. New homeowners appreciate knowing the HVAC systems have been professionally maintained.

## Getting Started

Enrollment is straightforward. Call us at **(905) 574-3952** to discuss your equipment and select the plan that makes sense for your home. We'll schedule your first maintenance visit at a time that works for your schedule—including evenings and weekends if needed.

Once enrolled, we handle the rest. You'll receive reminders before each scheduled visit. Your maintenance history is documented in our system, creating a complete service record for your equipment.
