Reducing energy consumption not only lowers your utility bills but also reduces your environmental impact. Here are five effective ways to improve your home's energy efficiency.

## 1. Upgrade to a Programmable Thermostat

Smart and programmable thermostats automatically adjust temperatures based on your schedule, preventing energy waste when you're away or asleep. This simple upgrade can reduce heating and cooling costs by 10-30%.

## 2. Seal Air Leaks

Air leaks around windows, doors, and ductwork force your HVAC system to work harder. Sealing these leaks with weatherstripping and caulk is a cost-effective way to improve efficiency.

## 3. Maintain Your HVAC System

Regular maintenance ensures your heating and cooling equipment operates at peak efficiency. Clean filters, proper calibration, and timely repairs prevent energy waste and extend equipment life.

## 4. Improve Insulation

Proper insulation in your attic, walls, and basement helps maintain consistent indoor temperatures, reducing the workload on your HVAC system. This is especially important in Ontario's variable climate.

## 5. Consider High-Efficiency Equipment

When it's time to replace your HVAC equipment, choose high-efficiency models. While they cost more initially, Energy Star-certified systems significantly reduce operating costs over their lifespan.
