As winter approaches in Southern Ontario, ensuring your furnace is ready for the cold months ahead is crucial for maintaining a comfortable and safe home. Here are essential maintenance tips to keep your heating system running efficiently.

## Change Your Filters Regularly

One of the simplest yet most important maintenance tasks is changing your furnace filter. A clean filter improves air quality, reduces energy costs, and prevents strain on your system. Check your filter monthly and replace it when it appears dirty.

## Schedule Professional Maintenance

Annual professional maintenance is key to preventing unexpected breakdowns. Our technicians inspect all components, clean the system, and make necessary adjustments to ensure safe and efficient operation.

## Clear Vents and Registers

Ensure all heating vents and registers are clear of furniture, curtains, and other obstructions. Blocked vents reduce efficiency and can cause uneven heating throughout your home.

## Test Your Thermostat

Before the heating season begins, test your thermostat to ensure it's accurately controlling your furnace. Consider upgrading to a programmable or smart thermostat to improve comfort and reduce energy costs.

## Listen for Unusual Sounds

Pay attention to any unusual noises from your furnace, such as banging, rattling, or squealing. These sounds often indicate issues that require professional attention.
