Planning to replace your furnace? Understanding what furnace installation costs in Ontario can help you budget properly and avoid surprises. As a family-owned HVAC company serving Southern Ontario since 1994, we've helped thousands of homeowners navigate this important investment.

## Average Furnace Installation Costs in Ontario (2025)

Here's what Ontario homeowners can expect to pay for a complete furnace installation:

| Furnace Type | Price Range | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Standard Efficiency (80% AFUE) | $3,500 - $5,000 | Budget-conscious, mild climates |
| Mid-Efficiency (90-94% AFUE) | $4,500 - $6,500 | Most Ontario homes |
| High-Efficiency (95-98% AFUE) | $5,500 - $8,000+ | Maximum savings, eligible for rebates |

These prices include the furnace unit, professional installation, permits, and removal of your old system.

## What Affects Your Furnace Installation Cost?

Several factors determine your final price:

### 1. Furnace Efficiency Rating (AFUE)

Higher efficiency furnaces cost more upfront but save significantly on heating bills. A 96% AFUE furnace uses 20% less gas than an 80% AFUE model—that adds up quickly during Ontario winters.

### 2. Home Size and Heating Requirements

A larger home needs a more powerful furnace. Proper sizing is critical—an oversized furnace wastes energy, while an undersized one struggles to keep you warm. Our technicians perform detailed heat load calculations to recommend the right size.

### 3. Installation Complexity

Your installation cost may increase if:
- Ductwork modifications are needed
- The furnace location requires relocation
- Electrical upgrades are necessary
- Venting needs to be reconfigured

### 4. Brand and Features

Premium brands like Carrier, Lennox, and Trane command higher prices but often include better warranties and reliability. Features like variable-speed blowers and two-stage heating add comfort and efficiency.

## Ontario Rebates Can Reduce Your Cost

Take advantage of available rebates to lower your investment:

- **Enbridge Home Efficiency Rebate**: Up to $6,500 for high-efficiency upgrades
- **Canada Greener Homes Grant**: Up to $5,000 for eligible improvements
- **Municipal programs**: Many Ontario municipalities offer additional incentives

We handle all rebate paperwork for you, ensuring you receive every dollar you're entitled to.

## Why Proper Installation Matters

A furnace is only as good as its installation. Poor installation can:
- Reduce efficiency by 30% or more
- Void manufacturer warranties
- Create safety hazards
- Shorten equipment lifespan significantly

Our TSSA-licensed technicians follow manufacturer specifications exactly and test every system thoroughly before leaving your home.

## Signs You Need a New Furnace

Consider replacement if your furnace:
- Is more than 15-20 years old
- Requires frequent repairs
- Produces uneven heating
- Shows increased energy bills
- Makes unusual noises
