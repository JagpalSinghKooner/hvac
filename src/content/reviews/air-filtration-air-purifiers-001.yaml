text: "Severe allergies made spring unbearable until B.A.P installed a whole-home air filtration system in our Guelph home. They added a HEPA bypass filter and UV air purifier to our existing HVAC. The difference is remarkable - pollen counts inside dropped to almost nothing. My allergy symptoms have improved dramatically. Best investment for our family's health."
