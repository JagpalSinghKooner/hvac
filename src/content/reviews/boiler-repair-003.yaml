text: "The boiler in my Shelburne rental property kept tripping the high limit switch. Previous company couldn't figure it out. B.A.P's technician found scale buildup restricting water flow through the heat exchanger. They flushed the system, replaced the aquastat, and it's been running perfectly since. Finally found a boiler repair company that actually troubleshoots properly."
