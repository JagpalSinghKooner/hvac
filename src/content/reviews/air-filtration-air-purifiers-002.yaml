text: "As a physician in Kitchener, I wanted hospital-grade air quality at home. B.A.P installed a Lennox PureAir system that removes particles, germs, and odors. The MERV 16 filtration captures even the smallest particles. Combined with UV treatment, our indoor air quality rivals any medical facility. They explained the technology thoroughly and installation was seamless."
