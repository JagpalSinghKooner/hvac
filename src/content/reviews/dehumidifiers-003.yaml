text: "Running a portable dehumidifier in our Orangeville basement 24/7 was getting expensive. B.A.P upgraded us to a Santa Fe whole-basement dehumidifier that uses half the energy and handles twice the capacity. They mounted it properly with dedicated drainage. Basement is bone dry now and energy bills actually decreased. Much better long-term solution."
