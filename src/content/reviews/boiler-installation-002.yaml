text: "Converting from oil to natural gas boiler in our Milton home was a big decision. B.A.P walked us through the entire process - removing the old oil tank, running the new gas line, installing a Weil-McLain boiler. They coordinated with Enbridge for the gas connection and handled all TSSA inspections. The rebates they helped us get covered nearly $4,000 of the cost. Excellent project management."
