text: "Our Victorian home in Georgetown had the original cast iron boiler from the 1920s. B.A.P replaced it with a modern high-efficiency Navien boiler that works with our existing radiators. The installation was complex - new piping, expansion tank, controls - but their team handled everything professionally. Our home has never been more comfortable, and the hot water is endless now. True boiler specialists."
