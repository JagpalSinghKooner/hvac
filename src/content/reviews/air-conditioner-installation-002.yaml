text: "Replaced our 20-year-old AC with a new high-efficiency Carrier system in Kitchener. B.A.P handled everything from removing the old unit to installing the new condenser pad. The new AC is so much quieter - our neighbors thanked us! They also upgraded our thermostat to WiFi control. Professional installation with financing that fit our budget."
