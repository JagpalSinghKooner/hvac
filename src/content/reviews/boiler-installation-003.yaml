text: "We added radiant floor heating to our Brantford home renovation and B.A.P installed the boiler system to power it. They designed the zones, installed the manifolds, and integrated everything with our existing HVAC. Walking on warm floors in January is amazing! Their knowledge of hydronic heating systems is impressive - they explained every component and how to optimize it."
