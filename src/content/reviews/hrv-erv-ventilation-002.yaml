text: "After major energy efficiency upgrades to our Cambridge home, indoor air quality suffered. B.A.P recommended an ERV since our summers are humid. It exchanges stale air for fresh while managing moisture in both directions. Winter air isn't too dry, summer air isn't too humid. They integrated it with our existing HVAC controls beautifully."
