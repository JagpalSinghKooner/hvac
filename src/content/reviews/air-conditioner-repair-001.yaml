text: "AC stopped cooling during that heat wave in July - worst timing possible. B.A.P had a technician at our Hamilton home within 2 hours. Turned out to be a failed capacitor, which he replaced on the spot. Within 30 minutes we had cold air again. No upselling, just honest AC repair at a fair price. Now they're our go-to for all HVAC needs."
