text: "Humidity in our Burlington home was causing window condensation and mold in closets. B.A.P installed an AprilAire dehumidifier that works with our AC. Even when the AC isn't running, it keeps humidity controlled. The intelligent controls adjust automatically based on outdoor conditions. No more wiping windows or worrying about hidden mold growth."
