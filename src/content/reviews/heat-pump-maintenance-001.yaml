text: "Heat pumps need more maintenance than traditional systems, and B.A.P understands that. Their annual service for our Bolton heat pump includes checking refrigerant levels, cleaning both coils, testing defrost operation, and verifying auxiliary heat staging. They catch issues early and our system has run trouble-free for 4 years. Essential maintenance for heat pump longevity."
