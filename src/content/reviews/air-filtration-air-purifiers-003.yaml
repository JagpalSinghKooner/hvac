text: "With two kids with asthma in our Cambridge home, air quality is critical. B.A.P assessed our needs and installed an electronic air cleaner that works with our furnace. They also sealed ductwork leaks that were bringing in dusty attic air. The kids' symptoms have improved noticeably, and we're not dusting as often. Comprehensive approach to indoor air quality."
