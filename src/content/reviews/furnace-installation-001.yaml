text: "After 18 years, our old furnace finally gave out. B.A.P came to our Guelph home and did a complete heat loss calculation - something no other company offered. They recommended a properly-sized Lennox furnace that's already cut our heating bills by 35%. The 10-year parts and labour warranty gave us complete peace of mind. Installation was done in one day, and they even programmed our new smart thermostat."
