text: "Opening our new dental practice in Oakville required precise climate control for patient comfort and equipment requirements. B.A.P understood medical facility HVAC needs including proper air exchanges and humidity control. They installed a system that maintains perfect conditions in each operatory. Quiet operation means patients can relax during procedures. Highly recommend for healthcare facilities."
