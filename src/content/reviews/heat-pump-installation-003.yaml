text: "Added a heat pump to supplement our propane furnace in Grand Valley. B.A.P installed a Daikin Fit system that takes over heating down to about -10°C, then the furnace kicks in for the coldest days. The hybrid setup was their recommendation and it's working perfectly. Already seeing significant propane savings. Their heat pump expertise and honest advice made the difference."
