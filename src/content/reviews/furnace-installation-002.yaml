text: "We bought a century home in Fergus that had an ancient furnace in the crawl space. B.A.P's TSSA-certified team relocated everything to a proper utility room and installed a high-efficiency Carrier furnace. They handled all the permits, passed inspection on the first try, and helped us apply for the Greener Homes Grant rebate. Extremely professional from start to finish."
