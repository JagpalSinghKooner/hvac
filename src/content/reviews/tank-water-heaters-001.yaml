text: "Our 15-year-old water heater was rusty and inefficient. B.A.P installed a new 50-gallon power vent tank in our Guelph home. They handled the old unit removal, new venting through the wall, and even upgraded the gas line. Hot water recovery is much faster now, and our gas bills dropped. Professional water heater installation with proper permits."
