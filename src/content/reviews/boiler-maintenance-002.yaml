text: "Managing a small apartment building in Elmira with a central boiler system. B.A.P has been our maintenance provider for 3 years. They're always thorough, check every zone valve and pump, and catch issues before tenants complain. Last year they identified a failing zone controller that would have left half the building cold. Proactive service worth every penny."
