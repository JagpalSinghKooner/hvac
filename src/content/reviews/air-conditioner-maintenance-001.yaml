text: "Annual AC tune-up with B.A.P at our Oakville home every spring. They clean the condenser coils, check refrigerant levels, test the capacitor, and inspect all electrical connections. Last year they caught a weak capacitor before it failed in summer. Their preventive maintenance has kept our 12-year-old AC running efficiently. Worth every penny for peace of mind."
