text: "Managing 12 rental units in Brantford, scheduled maintenance prevents costly emergency calls. B.A.P's commercial maintenance plan covers all our properties with coordinated service visits. They track each unit's history and flag equipment approaching end of life so I can budget replacements. Their detailed reports help with property documentation. Essential service for any property manager."
