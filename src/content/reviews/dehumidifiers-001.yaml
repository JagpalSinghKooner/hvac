text: "Our Guelph basement was damp and musty every summer. B.A.P installed a whole-home dehumidifier ducted into our HVAC system. It removes 90 pints per day and drains automatically to the floor drain. Basement humidity stays at 50% now - no more musty smell or concerns about mold. They sized it properly for our full basement square footage."
