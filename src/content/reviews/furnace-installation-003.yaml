text: "As a first-time homeowner in Kitchener, I was nervous about such a big purchase. Paul from B.A.P took the time to explain the difference between single-stage and variable-speed furnaces without any pressure. The financing option made it affordable, and the installation team was incredibly clean - they even wore booties and laid down drop cloths. Our new Goodman furnace heats evenly throughout the house."
