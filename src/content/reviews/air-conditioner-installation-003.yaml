text: "Our Waterloo townhouse needed AC for the hot summers. B.A.P recommended a compact 2-ton unit that fit our small lot and matched our existing furnace. Installation was completed in one day, and they helped us understand the Enbridge rebate program. The technicians were respectful of our home and cleaned up completely. Great AC installation experience."
