text: "First time getting professional furnace maintenance for my Elora farmhouse - wish I'd done it sooner! The B.A.P technician found my air filter hadn't been changed in who knows how long, and the blower motor was working overtime. After cleaning everything and adjusting the gas pressure, my furnace runs so much quieter and our energy bills dropped noticeably. Now on their annual maintenance reminder list."
