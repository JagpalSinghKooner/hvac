text: "Been using B.A.P for annual furnace tune-ups at our Oakville home for 5 years now. Their 21-point inspection is thorough - they check the heat exchanger, clean the burners, test safety controls, and replace the filter. Last fall they caught a small crack in my inducer motor housing before it failed. The maintenance plan pays for itself in peace of mind and efficiency savings."
