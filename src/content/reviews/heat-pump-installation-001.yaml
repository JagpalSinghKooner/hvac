text: "Skeptical about heat pumps in Ontario winters, but B.A.P convinced us a cold-climate Mitsubishi Hyper-Heating system would work for our Guelph home. They were right! It heats effectively down to -25°C and cut our heating costs by 40%. The dual-fuel backup with our existing furnace gives us complete confidence. B.A.P really knows heat pump technology and proper sizing."
