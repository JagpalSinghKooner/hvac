text: "Our cottage in Fergus needed a reliable hot water solution for weekend visits. B.A.P installed a Rinnai tankless unit that fires up instantly when we arrive. No more waiting for a tank to heat up or worrying about it running when we're not there. They installed it in a compact space and explained the annual maintenance. Perfect solution for our seasonal property."
