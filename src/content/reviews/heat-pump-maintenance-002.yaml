text: "Twice-yearly heat pump maintenance with B.A.P at our Halton Hills home - spring for cooling season, fall for heating. Their technicians document everything and explain any concerns. They recently found our outdoor unit slightly unlevel from frost heave and corrected it before it caused compressor issues. That's the kind of attention to detail that extends equipment life."
