text: "As seniors in Milton, we wanted someone reliable for our HVAC maintenance. B.A.P's plan includes priority scheduling and discounts on any repairs needed. The technicians are always respectful, explain what they're checking, and clean up after themselves. Last fall they recommended replacing our filter more often due to our cats - small details that show they care about our specific situation."
