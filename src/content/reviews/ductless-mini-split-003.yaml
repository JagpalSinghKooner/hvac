text: "Converted our detached garage in Brantford into a workshop and needed year-round climate control. B.A.P installed a single-zone Fujitsu mini-split that heats to -25°C and cools in summer. The unit is rated for cold climates and hasn't struggled even on the coldest days. They ran the line set neatly and the whole installation took half a day. Exactly what we needed."
