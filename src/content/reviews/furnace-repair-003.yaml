text: "When our 12-year-old furnace started short cycling, we feared the worst. B.A.P sent a licensed technician to our Hamilton home who diagnosed a clogged condensate drain. He cleaned it out, checked the heat exchanger for cracks with a camera, and gave us an honest assessment: 'You've got a few more years in this unit.' Saved us thousands with his honesty. Will definitely call them when it's time to replace."
