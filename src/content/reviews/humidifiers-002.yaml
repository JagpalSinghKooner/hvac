text: "Our Oakville home felt like a desert every winter - humidity dropping to 15%. B.A.P installed a steam humidifier that maintains consistent 40% humidity regardless of outdoor temperature. It uses more water than bypass types but delivers precise control. Our hardwood floors stopped gapping and our sinuses thank us. Professional installation with no leaks."
