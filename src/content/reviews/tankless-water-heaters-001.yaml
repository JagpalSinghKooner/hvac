text: "Switched from a 60-gallon tank to a Navien tankless unit in our Waterloo home. B.A.P handled the complete conversion including upgrading the gas line and adding the condensate drain. Now we have endless hot water for our family of five - no more cold shower complaints! The wall-mounted unit freed up valuable space in our utility room. Energy bills dropped noticeably."
