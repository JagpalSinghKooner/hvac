text: "The heat pump at our Jerseyville farmhouse was running constantly but not reaching temperature. B.A.P found a failed compressor contactor and dirty outdoor coil. Simple fixes that made a huge difference. They also cleaned the indoor coil and checked the air handler. Transparent about what was wrong and what it would cost. Fair, honest heat pump repair service."
