text: "Upgraded from a rental water heater to an owned high-efficiency tank in Burlington. B.A.P explained the long-term savings of buying versus renting. They installed a Bradford White unit with a 12-year warranty. No more monthly rental fees, and the new unit heats water faster. Simple math that saves hundreds per year. Great advice and installation."
