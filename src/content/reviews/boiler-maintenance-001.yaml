text: "Annual boiler service with B.A.P keeps our Rockwood heritage home running smoothly. They check the flame pattern, test the safety controls, flush the low water cutoff, and ensure proper combustion. After 8 years of their maintenance, our 20-year-old boiler still runs like new. Their attention to hydronic system maintenance is exceptional - they understand boilers better than anyone."
