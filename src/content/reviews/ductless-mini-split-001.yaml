text: "Added a Mitsubishi ductless system to our Guelph home addition that couldn't be connected to existing ductwork. B.A.P installed a two-zone system with wall units in the sunroom and home office. The heating and cooling is instant, and each room has independent temperature control. Whisper quiet operation and the installation was incredibly clean - just small holes for the line sets."
