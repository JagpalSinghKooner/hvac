text: "Woke up to no heat and cold radiators in our Orangeville home. B.A.P diagnosed a failed circulator pump and had a replacement installed the same day. Their technician also noticed the pressure relief valve was corroded and replaced it preventatively. Knowledgeable boiler repair techs who understand hydronic systems inside and out. Saved us from a potentially dangerous situation."
