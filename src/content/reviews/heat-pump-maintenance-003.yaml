text: "Our mini-split heat pumps in our Cambridge addition get annual maintenance from B.A.P. They clean the wall unit filters and blower wheels, flush the condensate drains, and check the outdoor unit refrigerant. The units run quietly and efficiently after each service. They service all brands - ours is Fujitsu and they know the systems well."
