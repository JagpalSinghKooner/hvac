text: "I manage several rental properties in Burlington and B.A.P handles all my furnace maintenance. They're always on time, their technicians are background-checked and professional, and they send detailed reports after each visit. When a tenant's furnace needed repair, they prioritized it because of our maintenance agreement. Reliable service for landlords and property managers."
