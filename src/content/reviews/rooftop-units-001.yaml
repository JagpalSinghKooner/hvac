text: "Replaced aging rooftop units at our Burlington restaurant. B.A.P crane-lifted the new Carrier units onto the roof and had us operational in one day - critical for a restaurant that can't close. The new RTUs handle our kitchen exhaust makeup air properly and keep the dining room comfortable even during summer rushes. Professional commercial installation with minimal business disruption."
