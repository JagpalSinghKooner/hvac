text: "B.A.P maintains both our AC and furnace at our Milton property under their maintenance plan. The spring AC service is thorough - they even check the condensate drain and clean the indoor coil if needed. Two visits per year and priority scheduling if anything goes wrong. The plan pays for itself in efficiency and avoided repairs."
