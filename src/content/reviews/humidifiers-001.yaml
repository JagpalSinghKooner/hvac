text: "Ontario winters are brutal on indoor humidity. B.A.P installed an Aprilaire whole-home humidifier connected to our furnace in Waterloo. No more static shocks, cracked wood floors, or dry skin. They set the humidistat properly for our climate and showed us how to maintain it. The difference in comfort during heating season is incredible."
