text: "Our Georgetown auto shop needed heating that could handle open bay doors in winter and cooling for the waiting area. B.A.P installed radiant tube heaters in the shop and a separate split system for the customer lounge. They understood the unique challenges of automotive service facilities. Now technicians work comfortably year-round and customers wait in a pleasant environment."
