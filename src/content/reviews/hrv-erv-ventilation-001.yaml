text: "Our tight new-build home in Kitchener was stuffy with stale air and excess humidity. B.A.P installed an HRV system that brings in fresh outdoor air while recovering 80% of the heat. Air quality improved immediately, and we no longer have condensation issues. They balanced the system perfectly so every room gets proper ventilation. Essential for modern airtight homes."
