text: "Our Kitchener manufacturing facility needed a complete HVAC overhaul. B.A.P designed and installed a multi-zone system that handles our production floor heat loads and keeps office areas comfortable. They worked around our production schedule, completing most work on weekends. The new system cut our energy costs by 30% and employees are much happier. True commercial HVAC expertise."
