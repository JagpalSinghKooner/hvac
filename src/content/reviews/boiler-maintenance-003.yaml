text: "Our Eden Mills home has a combination boiler for heat and hot water. B.A.P's annual service includes checking the domestic hot water function, not just the heating side. They descaled the heat exchanger and adjusted the modulation - now we have consistent hot water pressure throughout the house. Comprehensive boiler maintenance that covers everything."
