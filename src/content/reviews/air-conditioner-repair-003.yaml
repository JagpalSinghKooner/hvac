text: "Ice was forming on the AC lines at our Cambridge home, and some vents weren't blowing cold. B.A.P found a refrigerant leak at a flare fitting, repaired it, and recharged the system properly. They also cleaned the evaporator coil which was dirty. The 90-day repair guarantee gave us confidence. Now our AC cools every room evenly again."
