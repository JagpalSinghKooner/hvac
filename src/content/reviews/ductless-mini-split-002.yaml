text: "Our Georgetown century home has no ductwork, so central AC wasn't an option. B.A.P installed a multi-zone Daikin mini-split with three indoor units. The wall units blend in nicely, and each bedroom has its own temperature. The system also heats, which has reduced our baseboard heater use significantly. Perfect solution for older homes without ducts."
