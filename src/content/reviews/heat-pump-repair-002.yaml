text: "Heat pump outdoor unit was icing up even though defrost was running. B.A.P's technician found low refrigerant from a slow leak at the service valve. He repaired the leak, recharged the system, and verified proper superheat and subcooling. Most HVAC companies around Erin don't have this level of heat pump expertise. Highly recommend for heat pump repairs."
