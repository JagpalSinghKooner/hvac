text: "Our furnace stopped working at 2 AM during that cold snap in February. B.A.P answered immediately and had a technician at our Cambridge home within 45 minutes. He diagnosed a failed ignitor, had the part on his truck, and had us warm again by 4 AM. No overtime charges, just the quoted price. These are the emergency HVAC pros you want on speed dial."
