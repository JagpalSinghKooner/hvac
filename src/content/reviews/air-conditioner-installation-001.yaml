text: "Finally added central AC to our 1980s Guelph home. B.A.P did a heat load calculation and recommended a 3-ton Lennox unit - smaller than we expected but perfectly sized. They ran new ductwork through the basement and connected everything to our existing furnace. The house cools evenly now, and the 10-year warranty covers everything. Should have done this years ago!"
