text: "Managing several retail properties in Hamilton, I've used B.A.P for multiple rooftop unit replacements. They assess each unit honestly - some just needed repairs, others truly needed replacement. Recent installation of three new Lennox units went smoothly with crane work coordinated around tenant business hours. Fair pricing and they maintain detailed service records for each property."
