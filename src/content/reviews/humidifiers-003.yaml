text: "Had portable humidifiers all over our Hamilton home - constant refilling and mold concerns. B.A.P replaced them all with one whole-house bypass humidifier. It connects to the water supply and drains automatically - zero maintenance beyond an annual pad change. They sized it correctly for our home's square footage. Clean, efficient humidity control."
