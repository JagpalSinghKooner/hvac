text: "I called three companies about my furnace making a loud banging noise. Two wanted to sell me a new unit without even looking. B.A.P's technician came to my Waterloo townhouse, found a loose blower motor mount, and fixed it in 20 minutes. Honest service at a fair price - they could have easily oversold me but didn't. That 90-day repair guarantee shows they stand behind their work."
