text: "Water heater started leaking at our Hamilton rental property - needed emergency replacement. B.A.P came same day, removed the failing unit, and installed a new Rheem tank. They worked around the tenants' schedule and cleaned up completely. As a landlord, having a reliable contractor for water heater emergencies is invaluable. Fair pricing, fast service."
