text: "Our Guelph gym's old rooftop units couldn't keep up with the heat from cardio equipment and crowded classes. B.A.P sized new units properly for our actual cooling load, not just square footage. The gym stays comfortable now even during peak evening hours. They installed programmable controls that match our class schedule. Members noticed the improvement immediately."
