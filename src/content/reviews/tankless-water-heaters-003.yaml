text: "Running a bed and breakfast in Elora means guests expect hot water anytime. B.A.P installed two tankless units in parallel to handle peak demand. Even with multiple showers running simultaneously, water stays hot. They calculated our flow requirements precisely and the installation passed inspection first time. Guests are happy and our utility costs are lower than the old tank system."
