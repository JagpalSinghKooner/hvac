text: "Our 5-year-old heat pump stopped heating during a cold spell. B.A.P diagnosed a failed reversing valve - not a common repair, but their technician had it replaced within two days. They even verified the refrigerant charge and checked the defrost cycle. Finding a company that truly understands heat pump systems in Breslau isn't easy, but B.A.P exceeded expectations."
