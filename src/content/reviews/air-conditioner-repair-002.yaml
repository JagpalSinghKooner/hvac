text: "Our AC was blowing warm air and the outdoor unit was making a grinding noise. B.A.P's technician in Burlington diagnosed a failing compressor. Rather than just replace it, he explained our options honestly - repair vs. replace given the system's age. We decided to repair, and two years later it's still running great. Trustworthy AC repair advice."
