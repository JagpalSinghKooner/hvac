text: "Built a home office addition in Milton with no windows that could open. B.A.P installed a dedicated HRV to provide continuous fresh air ventilation. The CO2 levels stay low even after hours of work, and it's whisper quiet. They ran the ductwork discreetly and tied it into the main system controls. Fresh air on demand without opening windows."
