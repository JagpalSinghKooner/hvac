text: "Replaced our aging AC and furnace with a Carrier Infinity heat pump system at our Caledon property. B.A.P handled the complete changeover including the air handler and all ductwork modifications. The Greener Homes Grant rebate they helped us claim was substantial. We now heat and cool with one efficient system - exactly what we wanted for our net-zero goals."
