text: "First time getting professional AC maintenance for our Fergus home after moving from the city. B.A.P's technician found our condenser completely clogged with cottonwood seeds and the filter hadn't been changed in ages. After cleaning everything, our AC runs so much better and the electric bills dropped noticeably. Now on their annual reminder list."
