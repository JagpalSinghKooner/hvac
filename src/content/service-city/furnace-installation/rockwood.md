localContext: |
  Rockwood's scenic setting at the Eramosa River gorge creates a community with distinctive character and unique heating considerations. The village's limestone heritage dates to the 1840s, with historic buildings along Main Street featuring thick stone walls that require powerful heating systems sized for significant thermal mass. The Harris Woollen Mill ruins and surrounding conservation lands influence local microclimates, with riverside properties experiencing cooler, more humid conditions. Established residential areas blend century homes with mid-century builds and newer infill, creating diverse heating requirements. Rockwood's compact village layout and heritage atmosphere attract residents seeking small-town living within commuting distance of Guelph, leading to renovations of older properties that often include heating system upgrades. The surrounding rural properties feature larger lots and sometimes multiple outbuildings with heating needs. Guelph Hydro (Alectra) serves Rockwood, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebate programs for high-efficiency upgrades. The Eramosa Karst conservation area's unique geological features—Ontario's only accessible karst system—influence groundwater and humidity patterns in the area.

  testimonial: "Our stone cottage near the conservation area was freezing every winter - the walls just held the cold. B.A.P installed a properly sized high-efficiency furnace with a variable-speed blower that finally overcomes those thick stone walls. Our home actually feels cozy now."
