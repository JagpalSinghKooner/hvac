  headline: 'Outdated Heating Systems in Growing Family Homes'
  description: |
    New Hamburg families face furnace challenges that reflect the community''s growth trajectory. Older homes in the Huron Street area often have furnaces from the 1990s that lack the efficiency modern families need to manage rising energy costs on family budgets. As homes get renovated and finished basements add living space, original furnaces become undersized—running constantly to heat expanded square footage, leading to premature equipment failure and cold rooms where kids do homework or families gather.

    Many newer developments feature open-concept floor plans that create uneven heating without proper airflow design. Standard builder-grade furnaces installed 10-15 years ago struggle with today''s tighter building envelopes, cycling inefficiently and creating humidity problems during heating season. Busy families postpone furnace replacement until equipment fails completely, forcing rushed decisions during winter when choices are limited and installation timelines stretched.
  issues:
    - 'Undersized furnaces struggling to heat renovated spaces and finished basements'
    - 'Open floor plans creating temperature stratification without proper airflow design'
    - 'Aging equipment from original home construction nearing end of service life'

solution:
  headline: 'Custom Furnace Installation for Modern Comfort Needs'
  description: |
    Our installation process begins with heat loss calculation that accounts for both current square footage and likely future changes—finishing that basement or adding a sunroom shouldn''t require replacing your furnace again in 10 years. We size equipment based on actual building envelope performance, not outdated rules of thumb, ensuring systems run efficiently rather than oversizing "just to be safe" and creating short-cycling problems.

    Variable-speed furnaces solve the uneven heating common in open-concept homes, adjusting airflow dynamically to maintain consistent temperatures whether you''re heating 1,800 or 2,400 square feet. Two-stage burners provide gentle heating during mild weather while delivering full capacity when January temperatures drop to -20°C. We design duct systems to deliver balanced air distribution to every room, addressing the common New Hamburg complaint of cold bedrooms while the main floor overheats.

    Installation timing works around family schedules—we complete most residential furnace changeouts in one day, minimizing disruption to homework, meal prep, and evening routines. TSSA-certified technicians handle all gas connections and venting to code, with inspections completed so you have documentation and peace of mind.

trustOpener: 'Since 1994, B.A.P has been installing furnaces across New Hamburg''s diverse properties, from established family homes on Huron Street to newer developments in expanding neighborhoods. Three decades and over 1,100 installations create pattern recognition—we know which furnace models handle open floor plans effectively, how to size systems for growing families, and how to complete installations without turning your family''s day upside down. When you are investing $12,000-$15,000 in heating equipment that needs to last through 20 Ontario winters, institutional knowledge matters.'

contextHeadline: 'Furnace Systems Designed for Wilmot Township Climate'
context: |
  New Hamburg''s position in Wilmot Township creates heating requirements shaped by both climate and housing trends. Winter design temperatures around -22°C demand furnaces capable of maintaining indoor comfort during extended cold snaps when kids are home from school and families spend more time indoors. The community''s growth over the past two decades means housing stock ranges from 1970s bungalows to 2020s two-story builds, each with different envelope performance and heating challenges.

  Established neighborhoods feature homes with finished basements and renovated kitchens that have increased living space beyond what original furnaces were sized for. Newer developments near Highway 7/8 have larger footprints and open-concept designs that require careful airflow planning to avoid cold bedrooms. Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro provides electricity service, making high-efficiency furnaces with variable-speed blowers economical despite slightly higher upfront costs. Enbridge Gas supplies natural gas across Wilmot Township, providing the fuel reliability heating systems depend upon.

  With 32 years and over 1,100 installations serving New Hamburg, we understand how family life and home renovations affect furnace requirements. Our approach prioritizes long-term value over short-term savings, ensuring systems remain appropriate as your family grows.

savings:
  headline: 'Rebate Programs That Make New Furnaces Affordable'
  description: |
    High-efficiency condensing furnaces (96+ AFUE rating) reduce natural gas consumption by 30-35% compared to the 80% efficiency equipment common in older New Hamburg homes, translating to $550-$800 annual savings for typical family properties. Variable-speed blowers use 75% less electricity than older single-speed motors while improving comfort through continuous gentle air circulation. Properly sized equipment runs more efficiently and lasts longer—20-25 years for quality furnaces in residential applications—spreading the initial investment across two decades of reliable service.

    The combination of lower monthly utility bills and extended equipment lifespan means a premium furnace pays for itself within 10-12 years, then continues delivering savings for another decade. For families planning to stay in New Hamburg long-term, investing in quality equipment makes financial sense beyond the immediate rebate value.
  rebateInfo: 'Save on Energy provides up to $2,500 for qualifying high-efficiency furnace installation through Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro, plus Enbridge Home Efficiency Rebate offers additional savings on gas heating upgrades.'

  testimonial: 'Our 15-year-old builder-grade furnace could not keep up after we finished the basement for the kids'' playroom. B.A.P installed a new variable-speed Lennox furnace sized properly for our expanded square footage. Our gas bills dropped by $65 monthly, the basement stays comfortable year-round, and we got $2,800 back in rebates. The one-day installation meant minimal disruption to our family schedule.'
