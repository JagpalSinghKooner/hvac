localContext: |
  Breslau's transformation from quiet village to booming residential community has created diverse heating needs. The original village core along Woolwich Street features heritage homes from the late 1800s and early 1900s, many with converted heating systems needing modernization. However, Breslau's dramatic growth over the past fifteen years has added thousands of new homes in developments like Hopewell Heights and Thomasfield, featuring modern construction with builder-grade equipment. These newer homes often have large open-concept layouts and two-storey designs that require properly calculated heating loads—builder-installed furnaces are sometimes undersized for actual comfort needs. Breslau's position near the Grand River brings moderate humidity levels, while its slightly elevated terrain compared to downtown Kitchener can bring marginally cooler temperatures. Proximity to the Region of Waterloo International Airport means some properties experience specific sound considerations. Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro serves Breslau, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebate programs for high-efficiency upgrades. The ongoing expansion into Breslau's east side continues adding new developments with varying heating requirements.

  testimonial: "Our Hopewell Heights home came with a furnace that was clearly too small - the upstairs was always cold. B.A.P replaced it with a properly sized two-stage unit, and for the first time, our master bedroom is actually comfortable in January. Should have called them years ago."
