localContext: |
  Georgetown's position as Halton Hills' largest community combines historic charm with modern suburban growth. The heritage downtown along Main Street features beautiful Victorian and Edwardian architecture from the 1850s-1920s, with many buildings featuring residential uppers above commercial storefronts. The established Delrex, Mountainview, and Park neighbourhoods contain solid mid-century housing from the 1960s-80s with furnaces approaching or past typical replacement age. Georgetown's dramatic growth has added extensive new developments—including Glen Williams, the Evergreen, and areas along the 10 Side Road corridor—featuring modern construction with varying heating requirements. The Credit River valley creates distinct microclimates, with riverside properties experiencing cooler, more humid conditions. Georgetown's elevation on the Niagara Escarpment brings winters slightly cooler than lower Halton communities, with some lake-effect snow influence. Halton Hills Hydro serves the community, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebate programs for high-efficiency upgrades. The GO Transit station has made Georgetown attractive to Toronto commuters, driving continued growth and renovation activity in older neighbourhoods.

  testimonial: "Our Delrex home had a 25-year-old furnace that was increasingly unreliable. B.A.P replaced it with a high-efficiency model that heats our split-level evenly for the first time. The lower level family room is finally comfortable, and we are saving significantly on gas despite a harsh winter."
