  headline: 'When Your Aging Furnace Struggles Through Ontario Winters'
  description: |
    Furnaces over 15 years old in Woolwich Township face predictable decline. Older systems in rural homes work harder heating larger footprints and dealing with variable insulation levels across different property ages. When your furnace cycles more frequently, takes longer to reach temperature, or leaves cold spots in upstairs bedrooms, the question is not if replacement is needed but when. Waiting for mid-winter failure means rushed decisions and reduced equipment availability.

    Heritage properties in downtown Elmira often have furnaces installed when homes were smaller, before additions expanded square footage. Modern builds in newer developments sometimes have undersized equipment chosen to meet builder budgets rather than homeowner comfort needs. Agricultural properties and acreage homes face unique heating challenges where ductwork runs are longer and heat loss through older windows and doors increases demand on the system.

    Energy costs on aging furnaces climb every year. A 30-year-old 60% AFUE system wastes nearly half your natural gas heating dollars compared to modern 96% AFUE equipment. That difference compounds over 20 winters. When repairs start costing $800-$1,200 annually on equipment already past manufacturer life expectancy, replacement becomes the better investment.
  issues:
    - 'Furnace age exceeds 15-20 years with increasing repair frequency and costs'
    - 'Uneven heating across rooms indicates undersized equipment or ductwork issues'
    - 'Rising natural gas bills despite consistent usage patterns year over year'

solution:
  headline: 'Right-Sized Furnace Systems for Rural Properties'
  description: |
    Proper furnace installation starts with heat loss calculation specific to your Elmira property. We measure square footage, assess insulation R-values, document window quality, and account for Woolwich Township's -23°C winter design temperature. This calculation determines exact BTU requirements. Oversized furnaces short-cycle and waste energy. Undersized systems run constantly and never reach comfortable temperatures. Right-sized equipment delivers even heat and optimal efficiency.

    Equipment selection matches your home's specific needs. Variable-speed blowers adjust airflow for consistent comfort room to room. Two-stage burners modulate output to match heating demand rather than cycling on and off repeatedly. 96% AFUE ratings capture nearly all heat from natural gas combustion. We install to TSSA standards with proper venting, combustion air supply, and condensate drainage. The installation crew arrives with all required permits. The price we quote is the price you pay.

    New furnace installations include 10-year manufacturer warranty on parts and heat exchanger. We verify proper operation through startup, calibrate thermostat response, and document baseline performance. You receive maintenance recommendations to protect the warranty. Located at 25 Clearview Street serving Elmira since 1994, we will be here when you need service five, ten, fifteen years from now.

contextHeadline: 'Heating Solutions for Woolwich Township''s Climate'
context: |
  Elmira''s location in Woolwich Township means rural surroundings with less urban heat island effect and greater temperature swings than nearby Waterloo. Winter design temperature of -23°C demands furnace systems rated for extreme cold. Heritage properties downtown have century-old construction with variable insulation and older windows that increase heat loss. Modern builds in newer subdivisions feature better building envelopes but sometimes have ductwork designed for builder cost savings rather than optimal airflow.

  Rural acreage homes and agricultural properties face unique heating challenges. Longer ductwork runs to additions and outbuildings create pressure imbalances if not accounted for in system design. Larger square footages common in Woolwich Township require properly sized equipment. Community values in Elmira align with thorough work done right the first time. Mennonite heritage of craftsmanship and quality resonates with homeowners who expect installations to last decades without issues.

  Waterloo North Hydro serves Elmira for electricity. Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service throughout Woolwich Township. Natural gas availability makes high-efficiency furnaces the most economical heating choice for most properties. With 32 years and over 900 furnace installations serving Elmira, we understand how local housing stock and climate affect heating system requirements.
