localContext: |
  Milton's transformation from small town to booming suburban centre has created a unique mix of housing requiring diverse heating expertise. The historic Downtown core along Main Street features charming Victorian and Edwardian homes from the 1870s-1920s, many with original stone foundations and converted heating systems. Old Milton neighbourhoods like Timberlea and Dempsey contain solid 1980s-90s housing now approaching furnace replacement age. The massive wave of development since 2000—Harrison, Willmott, Scott, and Bristol neighbourhoods—features modern construction with builder-grade furnaces often undersized for today's larger floor plans. The Escarpment communities of Milton Heights and the rural properties along the Niagara Escarpment face unique wind exposure and temperature variations. Milton's rapid growth has strained infrastructure, making energy efficiency particularly important. Milton Hydro serves the community, while Enbridge Gas rebates help offset upgrade costs. The town's elevation and distance from Lake Ontario create colder winter conditions than lakeshore communities, with temperature extremes demanding reliable heating equipment. New developments near Britannia Road continue expanding the service area northward.

  testimonial: "Our Harrison home came with a builder-grade furnace that struggled from day one. B.A.P installed a properly sized high-efficiency unit that actually heats our whole house evenly. The basement is finally usable in winter, and our bills are lower despite better coverage."
