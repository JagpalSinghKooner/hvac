localContext: |
  Acton's leather-tanning heritage and small-town charm create a community with distinctive housing and heating needs. The historic Main Street features Victorian commercial buildings from the 1840s-1900s, many with residential upper floors requiring compact heating solutions that work within heritage constraints. The surrounding residential areas contain a mix of century workers' homes—originally built for tannery employees—alongside mid-century housing and newer subdivisions. The Beardmore district reflects Acton's industrial past with dense housing layouts typical of working-class neighbourhoods. Newer developments on Acton's perimeter cater to families seeking affordable entry into Halton Hills, featuring modern construction with standard builder equipment. Acton's position on the Niagara Escarpment brings specific climate considerations—the town experiences slightly cooler temperatures and increased precipitation compared to lower-elevation communities. Fairy Lake's presence in the town centre creates localized microclimate effects. Halton Hills Hydro serves Acton, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebate programs for efficiency upgrades. The Blue Springs Creek watershed influences humidity levels, affecting furnace sizing calculations.

  testimonial: "Our 1890s worker cottage in the Beardmore area had never been properly heated - previous owners just added space heaters. B.A.P designed a complete solution that works with our compact layout and original basement. For the first time, every room is comfortable and our heating is affordable."
