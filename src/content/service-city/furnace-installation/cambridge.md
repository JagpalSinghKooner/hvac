localContext: |
  Cambridge presents a fascinating mix of housing eras reflecting its amalgamation from Galt, Preston, and Hespeler. The historic Galt downtown core features beautiful stone homes from the 1850s-1900s, many perched on hillsides overlooking the Grand River, where gravity-fed heating systems and steep driveways complicate installations. Preston's textile mill heritage left behind dense worker housing from the early 1900s with compact footprints and shared-wall construction requiring careful heat load calculations. Hespeler maintains its village character with post-war bungalows and split-levels from the 1950s-60s. The Blair and Riverbank neighbourhoods experience cooler temperatures due to their proximity to the Grand River valley, often running 2-3 degrees colder than the city centre. Cambridge & North Dumfries Hydro serves most residents, while Enbridge Gas offers significant rebates for upgrading from mid-efficiency to high-efficiency furnaces. The growing subdivisions near Boxwood and Franklin Boulevard feature modern homes with open-concept layouts requiring properly sized equipment.

  testimonial: "Living on a steep hill in Galt made finding an HVAC company willing to do the job difficult. B.A.P not only handled the challenging access but installed a furnace that handles our drafty stone home perfectly. First winter we have been truly warm in 12 years."
