localContext: |
  Burlington's lakefront location and established neighbourhoods create specific heating considerations for homeowners. The historic Downtown and Old Lakeshore Road areas feature elegant homes from the 1920s-1950s, many with original steam or hot water systems that have been converted to forced air over the decades. Roseland and Shoreacres showcase mid-century architecture with basement mechanicals designed for oil-to-gas conversions. Aldershot, one of Burlington's original settlements, contains a mix of wartime housing and newer infill requiring careful load calculations. The Millcroft and Headon Forest areas feature larger 1980s-90s homes with two-storey layouts that often struggle with temperature balancing between floors. Burlington's proximity to Lake Ontario provides temperature moderation but also increases humidity levels, affecting equipment sizing. The newer Alton Village and expanding north-end developments near the 407 feature modern tight-envelope construction requiring right-sized equipment to prevent short-cycling. Burlington Hydro serves most residents, with Enbridge Gas rebates available for qualifying high-efficiency upgrades. The escarpment's presence creates wind patterns that can affect homes on the city's western edges.

  testimonial: "Our Millcroft home always had hot and cold spots - the master bedroom was freezing while the main floor overheated. B.A.P installed a two-stage furnace with proper zoning, and for the first time in 15 years, every room is comfortable."
