seoDescription: 'Professional furnace installation in Guelph, ON. TSSA-certified technicians, 10-year warranty, same-day quotes. Serving Guelph since 1992.'
trustOpener: 'Since 1994, B.A.P has been solving furnace challenges in Guelph''s diverse housing stock, from heritage limestone homes in the Ward to modern builds near Kortright Hills. Thirty years in one city creates pattern recognition most contractors lack. We know which furnace systems work in Guelph''s cold winters and humid microclimate conditions because we''ve installed and serviced thousands of them.'
problem:
  headline: When Your Furnace Reaches the End of Its Service Life
  description: Most furnaces in Guelph homes are sized for worst-case heating loads but run inefficiently for 95% of the season. Furnaces over 15 years old typically operate at 70-80% efficiency (compared to 80% when new), and that efficiency drops further each year as heat exchangers develop cracks and blower motors wear. In Guelph's cold winters where furnaces run October through April, an aging furnace can add $600 to $1,200 annually to heating costs while delivering inconsistent comfort.
  issues:
    - Furnaces installed before 2010 lack modulating or two-stage burners, cycling on and off frequently in Guelph's variable fall and spring temperatures, causing temperature swings of 3-5 degrees and uneven heating between floors
    - Heritage limestone homes in the Ward and St. Patrick's Ward often have furnaces sized for original layouts, not renovated open-concept spaces, leading to cold spots in additions and overheating in original rooms
    - Guelph's humidity (especially near the Speed River valley) causes condensation issues in older furnaces without proper venting, leading to rust, early heat exchanger failure, and potential carbon monoxide risks
    - Emergency mid-winter replacements in January or February mean limited equipment choices, rushed installations, and higher costs when contractors are slammed with service calls
solution:
  headline: 'Right-Sized Furnace Systems, Installed to Manufacturer Specifications'
  description: 'We start with a proper heat loss calculation for your Guelph home, accounting for insulation levels, window types, and local climate factors. This ensures your new furnace is sized correctly, not guessed based on square footage like many contractors do. Our TSSA-certified installers follow manufacturer specifications exactly, protecting your warranty and ensuring efficient operation. You get a furnace that heats evenly, runs efficiently, and lasts the full expected lifespan.'
context: |
  Guelph's diverse housing stock presents unique heating challenges that require specialized knowledge. The historic Ward neighbourhood features stunning Victorian and Edwardian homes built between 1880-1920, many with original stone foundations and converted coal furnace infrastructure that demands careful modernization. St. Patrick's Ward and the Old University area contain charming century homes with narrow basements and unique ductwork configurations. Meanwhile, newer developments in the south end near Kortright Hills and the growing communities around Hanlon Creek feature modern construction with high-efficiency requirements. Guelph's position at the confluence of the Speed and Eramosa Rivers creates a microclimate with slightly higher humidity levels, making proper furnace sizing critical to prevent short-cycling. Guelph Hydro (now Alectra) customers may qualify for time-of-use rate optimization when pairing a new furnace with a smart thermostat. Enbridge Gas rebates of up to $5,000 are available for qualifying high-efficiency furnace installations.
