localContext: |
  Guelph's diverse housing stock presents unique heating challenges that require specialized knowledge. The historic Ward neighbourhood features stunning Victorian and Edwardian homes built between 1880-1920, many with original stone foundations and converted coal furnace infrastructure that demands careful modernization. St. Patrick's Ward and the Old University area contain charming century homes with narrow basements and unique ductwork configurations. Meanwhile, newer developments in the south end near Kortright Hills and the growing communities around Hanlon Creek feature modern construction with high-efficiency requirements. Guelph's position at the confluence of the Speed and Eramosa Rivers creates a microclimate with slightly higher humidity levels, making proper furnace sizing critical to prevent short-cycling. Guelph Hydro (now Alectra) customers may qualify for time-of-use rate optimization when pairing a new furnace with a smart thermostat. Enbridge Gas rebates of up to $5,000 are available for qualifying high-efficiency furnace installations.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1905 stone home in the Ward had an ancient furnace that was impossible to service. B.A.P designed a custom solution that works with our narrow basement and historic ductwork. The house has never been this comfortable, and our gas bills dropped by 35%."
