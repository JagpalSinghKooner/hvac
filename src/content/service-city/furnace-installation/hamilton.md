localContext: |
  Hamilton's dramatic escarpment geography creates distinct heating challenges between the lower city and the Mountain. Downtown and the North End feature dense Victorian-era housing from the 1880s-1920s, with narrow lots, party walls, and basement furnace rooms originally designed for coal. Westdale's prestigious 1920s-40s homes near McMaster University showcase quality construction but aging heating systems. Locke Street and Kirkendall have seen extensive renovation, with homeowners seeking high-efficiency replacements that respect heritage architecture. The Mountain neighbourhoods—including Mohawk, Rymal, and the rapidly growing Binbrook area—feature everything from 1960s bungalows to brand-new subdivisions. Temperature inversions during winter can trap cold air in the lower city while the Mountain sits above the fog line. Hamilton's steel city heritage means many older homes have reinforced foundations but also legacy industrial contamination requiring careful installation practices. Alectra Utilities serves Hamilton, with rebate programs available through Enbridge Gas. Lake Ontario's proximity moderates extreme cold but increases humidity, affecting furnace efficiency calculations.

  testimonial: "Our 1912 North End home had a 30-year-old furnace in a cramped basement. B.A.P navigated the tight space and unusual ductwork to install a compact high-efficiency unit. The difference in air quality alone has been life-changing for our family."
