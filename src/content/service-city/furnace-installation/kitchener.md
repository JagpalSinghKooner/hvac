localContext: |
  Kitchener's rich industrial heritage and rapid growth have created one of Ontario's most diverse housing landscapes. The Victoria Park and Central Frederick neighbourhoods showcase elegant Victorian homes and classic brick workers' cottages from the 1890s-1920s, many still running original gravity furnaces or early forced-air conversions that desperately need updating. Forest Heights and Doon feature extensive 1960s-70s housing stock with aging mid-efficiency furnaces approaching end-of-life. The Huron Park and Alpine areas contain post-war homes with original ductwork often undersized for modern high-efficiency systems. Meanwhile, rapidly expanding areas like Williamsburg, Laurentian Hills, and Doon South feature large modern homes requiring properly calculated heating loads. Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro customers can take advantage of time-of-use rates, while Enbridge Gas rebates make upgrading from 80% to 96%+ AFUE furnaces financially attractive. Kitchener's continental climate brings harsh winters with temperatures frequently dropping below -20°C, demanding reliable, properly sized heating equipment.

  testimonial: "The original 1970s furnace in our Forest Heights home finally gave out mid-January. B.A.P had a new high-efficiency unit installed within 24 hours. The difference in comfort and our gas bills has been remarkable - we should have done this years ago."
