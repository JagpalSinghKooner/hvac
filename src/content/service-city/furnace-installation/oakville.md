localContext: |
  Oakville's affluent neighbourhoods demand premium heating solutions that match the town's high standards. The historic Downtown and Old Oakville areas feature stately homes from the late 1800s to mid-1900s, many designated heritage properties requiring installations that preserve architectural integrity. Bronte Village maintains its charming harbour-town character with a mix of original cottages and renovated properties. Glen Abbey's prestigious 1970s-80s homes, many backing onto the famous golf course, feature large footprints requiring properly sized equipment. The Clearview, Iroquois Ridge, and River Oaks neighbourhoods showcase executive homes with complex HVAC requirements including multi-zone systems. College Park and Falgarwood contain solid 1960s housing stock approaching furnace replacement age. North Oakville's explosion of development—Joshua Creek, Palermo Village, and the new Trafalgar corridor—features modern homes with tight building envelopes. Oakville Hydro serves the community, while Enbridge Gas rebates make efficiency upgrades attractive. Lake Ontario's influence keeps winters slightly milder but more humid than inland areas, requiring careful equipment selection for optimal performance and longevity.
