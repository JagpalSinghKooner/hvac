localContext: |
  Brantford's rich industrial heritage as the Telephone City has shaped its distinctive housing stock. The historic Downtown and West Brant neighbourhoods feature grand Victorian and Edwardian homes from the 1880s-1920s, many with converted coal furnaces and original gravity ductwork requiring careful modernization. Eagle Place, the city's original working-class neighbourhood, contains dense housing from the early 1900s with compact layouts and shared-wall construction. The North Ward and Terrace Hill areas showcase classic mid-century homes from the 1950s-60s with aging furnaces reaching end-of-life. East Ward and Holmedale feature diverse housing mixes reflecting decades of development. The growing suburbs along the Grand River—including newer developments near Wayne Gretzky Parkway—feature modern construction with different heating requirements. Brantford's position along the Grand River valley creates temperature inversions during winter, with cold air pooling in lower areas. Brantford Power serves the city, while Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service with rebate programs for efficiency upgrades. The revitalization of downtown Brantford has brought renewed investment in heritage property renovations requiring sensitive furnace installations.

  testimonial: "Our Victorian home on Dalhousie Street had original ductwork that other companies refused to work with. B.A.P took the time to design a solution that works with our historic home rather than against it. The installation was meticulous, and the results exceeded our expectations."
