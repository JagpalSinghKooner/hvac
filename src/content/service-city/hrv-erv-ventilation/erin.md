localContext: |
  Erin's picturesque village setting in the hills of Wellington County attracts homeowners seeking rural tranquility without sacrificing modern home comfort and efficiency. The community's mix of charming older village properties and custom-built rural homes each present distinct ventilation requirements our technicians address regularly. Historic homes in Erin Village undergoing energy retrofits need mechanical ventilation to maintain air quality after sealing traditional air leakage paths that provided natural but inefficient air exchange. Custom-built properties on larger lots throughout the township are typically designed to high energy standards with superior insulation and air sealing, requiring HRV systems from initial occupancy. Erin's elevation and rural location mean colder winter temperatures than urban centres, making heat recovery particularly valuable for maintaining comfort without excessive energy costs. The community's commitment to preserving its natural environment resonates with homeowners who choose ventilation systems that provide filtered fresh air while minimizing energy waste through heat recovery technology.
