localContext: |
  Oakville's premium housing market features exceptionally well-built homes where proper ventilation is essential for protecting both indoor air quality and the significant investment homeowners have made in their properties. Custom-built estates in areas like Morrison, Glen Abbey, and the lakefront Bronte neighbourhood achieve remarkable air sealing that can trap indoor pollutants, moisture, and volatile organic compounds without mechanical ventilation. The town's proximity to Lake Ontario creates humidity patterns that fluctuate seasonally, requiring ERV systems in homes where summer moisture control is a priority while HRV units excel for winter heat recovery applications. Newer developments in North Oakville, Palermo, and Joshua Creek meet stringent energy efficiency standards mandating continuous ventilation to maintain healthy indoor environments. Oakville homeowners often select premium ventilation equipment with enhanced filtration capabilities, HEPA options, and smart controls that integrate with whole-home automation systems, and our technicians are experienced with these advanced installations.
