localContext: |
  Caledon's sprawling rural landscape and estate properties feature custom-built homes designed to high energy efficiency standards where proper mechanical ventilation is essential for indoor air quality. The town spans diverse terrain from the Oak Ridges Moraine to the Niagara Escarpment, with elevation changes creating variable climate conditions across communities like Bolton, Caledon Village, Palgrave, and Inglewood. Custom homes throughout Caledon are typically built with superior insulation and air sealing that eliminates natural infiltration, requiring HRV or ERV systems to provide controlled fresh air supply. Estate properties with larger footprints need properly designed ventilation systems sized for extended ductwork runs and multiple zones. Caledon homeowners who chose the area for its natural beauty and clean air particularly value ventilation systems that filter incoming outdoor air while recovering indoor heat energy during cold months. Our installations throughout Caledon's communities are engineered for each property's specific size, layout, and occupancy requirements.

  testimonial: "Our custom home near Palgrave was built extremely airtight for energy efficiency. Without mechanical ventilation, the air became stale within hours. B.A.P designed and installed an HRV system sized perfectly for our 4,000 square foot home. The air quality is excellent throughout."
