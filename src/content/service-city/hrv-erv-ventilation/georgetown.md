localContext: |
  Georgetown serves as the largest community in Halton Hills, offering a diverse housing stock from heritage properties to modern subdivisions that each require proper mechanical ventilation for healthy indoor air. The historic downtown core features beautiful older buildings increasingly undergoing energy improvements that seal traditional air leakage paths, creating urgent need for controlled fresh air supply through HRV systems. Newer developments in areas like Delrex, Silver Creek, and the expanding south end are constructed to current Ontario Building Code standards requiring continuous ventilation in airtight homes. Georgetown's position along the Credit River and its proximity to the Niagara Escarpment create variable humidity conditions throughout the year, influencing whether HRV or ERV systems provide optimal performance for specific applications. Professional families who commute to the GTA while enjoying Georgetown's small-town atmosphere prioritize indoor air quality and energy efficiency, making heat recovery ventilation increasingly popular throughout the community.
