localContext: |
  Waterloo's innovation-driven community embraces advanced building technologies, making HRV and ERV systems a natural choice for the city's environmentally aware homeowners. The concentration of tech workers and university faculty creates demand for scientifically sound indoor air quality solutions in neighbourhoods like Beechwood, Laurelwood, and the uptown core. New construction in Vista Hills, Erbsville, and Columbia Forest meets rigorous energy efficiency standards that require mechanical ventilation systems to provide fresh air without wasting conditioned air. Student rental properties near the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University benefit significantly from continuous ventilation that removes cooking odours, excess humidity, and stale air common in high-occupancy dwellings. Waterloo's climate demands both heating efficiency in winter and humidity management in summer, making the choice between HRV and ERV systems an important consideration our technicians help homeowners navigate based on their specific household conditions and air quality priorities.
