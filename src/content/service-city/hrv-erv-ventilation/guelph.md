seoDescription: 'HRV and ERV ventilation installation in Guelph, ON. Fresh air with heat recovery. Serving Guelph since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Guelph has emerged as a leader in sustainable building practices, with the city's commitment to becoming a net-zero community by 2050 driving demand for energy-efficient ventilation solutions. The airtight construction standards in newer developments like Clair Hills, South End, and the revitalized Downtown core create ideal conditions for HRV and ERV systems. These tightly sealed homes trap indoor pollutants, cooking odours, and excess moisture without proper mechanical ventilation. Historic stone homes in the Ward and older properties near the University of Guelph often undergo energy retrofits that include improved insulation and air sealing, making fresh air ventilation essential. The Speed River valley's humidity levels fluctuate significantly between seasons, requiring ERV systems that manage moisture transfer effectively. Our Guelph installations consistently meet Ontario Building Code requirements for continuous ventilation while recovering up to 80% of heating energy that would otherwise be lost through traditional exhaust fans.
