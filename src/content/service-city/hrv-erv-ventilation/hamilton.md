seoDescription: 'HRV and ERV ventilation installation in Hamilton, ON. Fresh air with heat recovery. Serving Hamilton since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Hamilton's dramatic topography creates distinct ventilation needs across the city's lower and upper mountain neighbourhoods. Properties below the Niagara Escarpment in areas like Westdale, Kirkendall, and Durand experience higher humidity levels from Lake Ontario's influence, making ERV systems valuable for managing indoor moisture levels. The upper mountain communities of Ancaster, Dundas, and Waterdown feature newer construction built to modern airtight standards requiring mechanical ventilation for code compliance and healthy indoor air. Hamilton's extensive stock of century homes, particularly in the North End and Locke Street areas, increasingly undergo deep energy retrofits that seal traditional air leakage paths, creating urgent need for controlled fresh air supply. The city's industrial heritage means some neighbourhoods benefit from filtered fresh air systems that remove outdoor particulates while recovering indoor heat energy. Our Hamilton installations are designed to address each home's specific location, construction type, and indoor air quality priorities.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1910 home in Kirkendall was drafty until we had it properly insulated. Then we noticed musty smells and condensation everywhere. B.A.P recommended an HRV system that solved all our air quality issues while keeping our heating costs under control."
