problem:
  headline: 'Maintaining Comfort in Commercial and Retail Spaces'
  description: 'Commercial buildings demand more from HVAC equipment than homes. Retail spaces need consistent temperatures during business hours to keep customers comfortable. Office buildings require zone control for conference rooms versus workstations. Light industrial facilities balance employee comfort with process requirements. Equipment runs longer hours—12-16 hour days versus residential 8-hour cycles. Higher occupancy loads stress systems. Multiple thermostats create coordination challenges. Equipment failures affect revenue: uncomfortable customers leave, employees lose productivity, perishable inventory spoils. Residential HVAC technicians often lack commercial experience. They don''t understand three-phase power, roof access requirements, or code differences for commercial occupancies. Equipment sizing gets wrong—undersized systems can''t keep up, oversized units short-cycle and waste energy. Elmira businesses deserve contractors who know commercial building codes and can work around operating hours without disrupting your revenue stream.'
  issues:
    - 'Inadequate heating or cooling capacity during peak business hours'
    - 'Aging rooftop units failing more frequently and costing more to repair'
    - 'Temperature complaints from staff or customers affecting operations'

solution:
  headline: 'Commercial Heating and Cooling Installation Expertise'
  description: 'We approach commercial projects methodically. Start with heat load calculations that account for occupancy patterns, equipment heat gain, and building envelope. Commercial buildings need load analysis—not guesswork scaled up from residential formulas. Equipment selection considers duty cycle: a restaurant needs more robust systems than an office with the same square footage. Roof access planning matters for rooftop unit installations. We coordinate with property managers for after-hours work when needed—installation during business hours loses you revenue. Electrical requirements differ: three-phase power connections, proper disconnect sizing, code-compliant conduit runs. We handle permitting and inspection scheduling. Ductwork design balances airflow across multiple zones. Testing and commissioning verify every zone maintains setpoint under load. Documentation includes warranty registration and maintenance schedules. Small commercial projects in Woolwich Township benefit from three decades of experience with local building officials and code requirements. We know what passes inspection the first time.'

trustOpener: 'Since 1994, B.A.P has been installing commercial HVAC systems across Elmira''s business district, from Arthur Street retail stores to industrial facilities serving the agricultural community. Over 85 commercial projects create institutional knowledge—we know Woolwich Township building codes and which equipment handles rural commercial demands. When investing $15,000-$45,000 in business comfort systems, contractor expertise protects that investment.'

contextHeadline: 'Commercial HVAC Needs in Rural Ontario Communities'
context: |
  Elmira''s position as Woolwich Township''s commercial hub creates diverse business HVAC requirements. The Arthur Street downtown corridor features retail storefronts in century-old buildings—challenging installations working around heritage architecture constraints. Industrial areas serve agricultural manufacturing and processing facilities where climate control affects product quality. Office buildings range from professional services to municipal facilities. Each building type demands different equipment and installation approaches.

  Small commercial projects in rural Ontario face unique challenges. Contractors specializing in large urban commercial work often ignore projects under $50,000. But a 3,000-square-foot retail space or small office building still needs proper engineering and quality installation. Equipment selection matters: rural applications benefit from robust commercial-grade units that handle extended duty cycles, not light commercial equipment barely upgraded from residential specs.

  Waterloo North Hydro serves Elmira with electricity; Enbridge Gas provides natural gas. Most commercial installations use gas heating with electric cooling. Rooftop units dominate—they save valuable floor space and simplify installation. Three-phase power availability varies by location. With 32 years and over 85 commercial projects serving Woolwich Township, we understand local building codes, utility infrastructure, and which equipment suppliers service rural Ontario reliably.

savings:
  headline: 'Business Energy Savings Through Efficient Systems'
  description: 'Commercial HVAC represents significant operating costs—typically 30-40% of total facility energy consumption. Modern high-efficiency equipment reduces those costs substantially. A 95% AFUE rooftop unit versus 80% AFUE saves 18% on heating costs annually. For a business spending $6,000 yearly on heat, that''s over $1,000 saved every winter. Proper sizing matters: oversized equipment wastes energy through short cycling, while undersized systems run continuously at peak efficiency loss. Commercial equipment lasts 15-20 years with proper maintenance—the efficiency investment compounds over that lifespan. Smart thermostats with occupancy scheduling reduce waste during closed hours. Total cost of ownership includes purchase price, installation quality, and operating costs over equipment life.'
  rebateInfo: 'Save on Energy programs through Waterloo North Hydro provide commercial rebates for qualifying high-efficiency HVAC equipment, including rooftop units and heat pumps.'

proof:
  testimonial: 'Our retail space on Arthur Street had an aging rooftop unit that struggled to maintain temperature during summer. B.A.P assessed our actual cooling load, recommended right-sized replacement equipment, and installed it over a weekend so we didn''t lose business hours. The new unit keeps the store comfortable even during heat waves, and our electricity bills dropped noticeably. Professional work that respected our business operations.'
