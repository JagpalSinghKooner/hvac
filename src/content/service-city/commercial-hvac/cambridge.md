The industrial areas along Hespeler Road and Maple Grove Road house automotive suppliers, plastics manufacturers, and food processing facilities requiring heavy-duty ventilation and climate control systems. Downtown Galt's revitalized commercial district features restaurants, professional offices, and retail spaces in character buildings along Main Street and Water Street needing sensitive HVAC integration. The Cambridge Business Park and Toyota supplier corridor demand precision climate control for manufacturing processes and worker comfort. Preston and Hespeler commercial areas serve local businesses and growing residential communities with diverse heating and cooling requirements throughout the year.
