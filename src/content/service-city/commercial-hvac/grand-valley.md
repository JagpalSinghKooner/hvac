localContext: |
  Grand Valley's small-town commercial district and surrounding rural operations create specialized HVAC requirements. The Main Street business corridor features local restaurants, professional offices, and retail shops serving this tight-knit community and surrounding agricultural area. Feed mills, agricultural suppliers, and farm equipment dealers require robust ventilation and climate systems for demanding operational environments. The village's growing residential community drives increasing demand for local services including medical facilities, fitness centres, and retail requiring reliable year-round climate control. Grand Valley's location in the Grand River headwaters means businesses face significant temperature extremes, requiring HVAC systems designed for both intense summer heat and severe winter cold.
