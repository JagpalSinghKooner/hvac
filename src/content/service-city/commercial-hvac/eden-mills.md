This small community along the Eramosa River features local artisan businesses, the famous Eden Mills Writers Festival venues, and rural commercial operations requiring thoughtful climate solutions. The village's strong environmental identity, including its pursuit of carbon neutrality, means businesses often seek high-efficiency and sustainable HVAC options. Historic mill buildings and heritage structures housing local businesses require climate control that preserves architectural character while providing modern comfort.
