localContext: |
  Hamilton's industrial legacy and urban renewal create exceptional commercial HVAC opportunities across the city. The downtown James Street corridor features restaurants, entertainment venues, and professional offices in heritage buildings requiring careful climate control integration. The Mountain commercial areas along Upper James and Mohawk Road serve retail plazas, medical facilities, and service businesses with substantial year-round heating and cooling demands. Hamilton's extensive industrial zones around the harbour and Parkdale Avenue house steel fabrication, food processing, and manufacturing operations requiring heavy-duty ventilation and climate systems. The growing healthcare sector around McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences creates demand for precision climate control in medical and research facilities.
