localContext: |
  Fergus's Scottish heritage and thriving business community create substantial commercial HVAC demand across this picturesque town. The downtown St. Andrew Street corridor features restaurants, pubs, boutique retail, and professional services in limestone heritage buildings requiring careful climate control integration. The industrial areas along Highway 6 house manufacturing operations serving the automotive and agricultural sectors with substantial heating and ventilation requirements. The Tower Street commercial district provides retail and services for the growing residential community. Fergus's popularity as a tourist destination, particularly during the Highland Games and Scottish Festival, means businesses need robust HVAC systems capable of handling peak visitor seasons while maintaining efficiency during quieter periods.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our pub needed better climate control for our busy festival weekends. B.A.P installed a system that handles packed crowds in summer and keeps the place warm and welcoming in winter."
