localContext: |
  Bolton's role as Caledon's commercial centre creates concentrated HVAC demand across its growing business district. The Queen Street commercial corridor features restaurants, professional services, retail shops, and service businesses serving the rapidly expanding residential community. Industrial areas along Highway 50 and Coleraine Drive house manufacturing operations, automotive businesses, and logistics facilities requiring heavy-duty ventilation and climate systems. The Albion-Vaughan Road corridor contains retail plazas and commercial developments with substantial heating and cooling requirements. Bolton's position as a gateway community between urban GTA and rural Caledon means businesses serve diverse customers requiring comfortable, welcoming environments throughout the year.
