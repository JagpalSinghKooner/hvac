localContext: |
  Rockwood's village character and strategic location create distinct commercial HVAC opportunities. The Main Street commercial area features cafes, restaurants, and local retail serving both residents and visitors to Rockwood Conservation Area and the surrounding countryside. Professional offices and service businesses along Highway 7 cater to commuters and the growing residential community attracted to this picturesque village. Agricultural operations and rural commercial businesses throughout the area require reliable heating and ventilation systems for workshops, storage facilities, and farm operations. The village's proximity to Guelph and position on the popular cycling and hiking route network means seasonal visitor traffic creates variable demand for commercial climate control.
