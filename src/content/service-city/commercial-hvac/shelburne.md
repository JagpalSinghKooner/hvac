localContext: |
  Shelburne's position as a growing northern Dufferin hub creates expanding commercial HVAC opportunities. The Main Street commercial district features restaurants, professional services, retail shops, and local businesses serving both the town and surrounding agricultural community. Industrial areas along Highway 89 house manufacturing operations, agricultural suppliers, and logistics facilities with substantial heating and ventilation demands. The town's rapid residential growth drives increased retail and service business development requiring reliable climate control systems. Shelburne's location in the headwaters region means businesses experience the full range of Ontario's climate extremes, from humid summers to bitterly cold winters, demanding robust HVAC systems built for challenging conditions.

  testimonial: "When our main heating unit failed in January, B.A.P had a crew here within hours. They got us temporary heat immediately and completed the full replacement within a week. Saved our business."
