  headline: 'Replacing Boilers in Century-Old Village Homes'
  description: 'Boiler replacement in St. Jacobs heritage homes presents challenges beyond standard HVAC work. Original cast iron boilers occupy tight mechanical rooms with minimal access. Existing piping systems serve radiators and in-floor heating designed around lower efficiency equipment. Heritage architecture limits venting options due to historic facade preservation requirements. Aging equipment shows declining efficiency, frequent service needs, and safety concerns as heat exchangers corrode. Homeowners face uneven heating across rooms, rising fuel costs, and the complexity of matching modern boilers to vintage distribution systems. Cold spots appear in rooms farthest from the boiler. Concerns about finding equipment that fits existing spaces and works with current radiators create hesitation. These factors combine when systems approach end-of-life decisions.'
  issues:
    - 'Existing boiler over 20 years old showing efficiency decline'
    - 'Uneven heating across historic home with radiator system'
    - 'Rising natural gas costs despite normal usage patterns'
solution:
  headline: 'High-Efficiency Boilers for Heritage Property Comfort'
  description: 'Modern condensing boilers achieve 95%+ AFUE efficiency while working with your existing radiator system. We properly size new boilers using actual heat loss calculations for your specific home, not guesswork. Modulating burners adjust output to match demand, reducing temperature swings and fuel waste. Compact designs fit mechanical spaces that housed larger cast iron units. Outdoor reset controls adjust water temperature based on actual outdoor conditions, maximizing comfort and efficiency. Installation includes proper venting per TSSA standards, integration with existing piping, and system balancing to eliminate cold spots. We work within heritage building constraints, routing vents where they maintain facade appearance. Zoning options add room-by-room control without replacing radiators. Systems integrate with modern thermostats while preserving radiant heating comfort your home was designed around.'
trustOpener: 'Since 1994, B.A.P has been installing boilers in St. Jacobs heritage properties where appearance and performance both matter. We understand these buildings, value their character, and install systems that deliver modern efficiency without compromising what makes them special.'

context: |
  St. Jacobs heritage homes were designed around hydronic heating, and that remains the best approach for these buildings. Radiant heat from cast iron radiators or in-floor systems provides even, comfortable warmth without the air movement and dust circulation of forced air. Original construction features high ceilings, solid walls, and large windows that benefit from radiant heating's room-by-room approach. Century-old plaster and original finishes remain undisturbed since systems work with existing piping. The village's historic district standards require thoughtful mechanical equipment placement that maintains architectural character. Modern condensing boilers deliver efficiency advances while respecting what makes these homes work.

  Woolwich Township''s cold winters demand reliable heating. St. Jacobs'' location in the Conestogo River valley creates temperature variations that outdoor reset controls address automatically. Natural gas service from Enbridge Gas provides fuel supply. Waterloo North Hydro Electric serves homes for system controls and circulation pumps. The village''s artisan community and tourism activity means properties need comfortable environments year-round. Heritage building owners invest in systems that protect architectural integrity while delivering modern performance.
savings:
