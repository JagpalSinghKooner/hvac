localContext: |
  Halton Hills encompasses the charming communities of Georgetown and Acton, both featuring historic downtown cores where boiler heating systems are common in older properties. Georgetown's Main Street area and the established neighbourhoods near Fairy Lake contain numerous century homes and heritage buildings where radiators provide comfortable heat. Acton's historic mill town character includes many older homes with original boiler systems requiring modern replacements. The rural properties throughout Halton Hills, including farmhouses and estate homes on larger lots, often rely on boiler heating for its reliability and ability to heat large spaces evenly. Many Halton Hills homeowners converting barns or building custom rural properties choose hydronic in-floor heating for workshops, studios, and living spaces. The area's mix of heritage charm and rural character makes boiler expertise essential for local heating contractors.
