localContext: |
  Kitchener's historic neighbourhoods including Victoria Park, Mount Hope-Huron Park, and the Central Frederick area contain a significant inventory of pre-war homes where boiler heating with radiators remains common. The German heritage of the community is reflected in the solid brick construction of these older properties, many featuring original cast iron radiators that continue to provide excellent heat distribution. The Civic Centre neighbourhood and areas surrounding downtown maintain numerous boiler-heated homes built during Kitchener's industrial growth period. In-floor radiant heating has also gained popularity in newer Kitchener developments like Doon South and Huron Park, where homeowners appreciate the energy efficiency and comfort of hydronic systems. Whether replacing an aging boiler in a century home or installing new radiant systems, Kitchener properties benefit from the consistent, comfortable heat that boilers deliver.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We bought a 1920s brick home in Victoria Park with an ancient boiler that barely functioned. B.A.P installed a new high-efficiency system and even helped us add a radiator to the sunroom. Outstanding service."
