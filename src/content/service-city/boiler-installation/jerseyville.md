localContext: |
  Jerseyville's quiet rural setting between Hamilton and Brantford features properties where boiler heating systems provide reliable warmth through cold Ontario winters. This small community along Highway 52 includes heritage farmhouses and established homes where radiator heating has been standard for generations. The surrounding agricultural land features working farms and rural estate properties where boiler systems heat large structures evenly without the ductwork that forced air would require. Jerseyville's country properties often include workshops, studios, and outbuildings where in-floor radiant heating provides practical, durable warmth for various uses. Many Jerseyville homes still operate older boilers that are significantly less efficient than modern condensing units, presenting opportunities for upgrades that maintain comfortable radiant heat while dramatically reducing fuel consumption. The community's rural character attracts homeowners who appreciate quality construction and heating systems built to last.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our century farmhouse in Jerseyville had a boiler that was older than we were. B.A.P replaced it with a modern efficient unit that finally heats our drafty old house evenly. The upstairs bedrooms are warm for the first time in years."
