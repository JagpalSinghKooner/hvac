localContext: |
  Grand Valley's small-town character along the Grand River makes it a community where boiler heating systems remain common in older properties. The village centre features heritage buildings and older homes where radiators have provided comfortable, reliable heat for decades. The surrounding Dufferin County countryside includes numerous farmhouses and rural properties where boiler systems excel at heating large structures evenly through long, cold winters. Grand Valley's elevation and northern position mean residents experience some of the coldest temperatures in the region, making robust heating systems essential. Many Grand Valley properties still operate oil-fired boilers that homeowners are converting to more efficient natural gas or propane systems. The agricultural community surrounding Grand Valley appreciates boiler heating for workshops, processing facilities, and heated outbuildings where in-floor radiant systems provide practical, durable warmth.

  testimonial: "Our hundred-year-old farmhouse had an oil boiler that was expensive to run and unreliable. B.A.P converted us to propane with a modern high-efficiency unit. The house is warmer and our heating costs dropped significantly."
