  headline: Aging Boiler Systems in Heritage Guelph Homes
  description: Guelph's older neighborhoods (Ward, St. Patrick's Ward, downtown core) contain heritage homes originally built with boiler heating, and many still run cast-iron boilers from the 1970s through 1990s operating at 65% to 75% efficiency. These boilers were sized for poorly insulated homes with single-pane windows and minimal weatherization, but after decades of renovations and insulation upgrades, they are often 30% to 50% oversized, cycling on and off frequently and wasting fuel. Modern condensing boilers deliver 95% efficiency but require proper venting, condensate drainage, and integration with existing radiator or in-floor heating systems.
  issues:
    - Cast-iron boilers in limestone foundation mechanical rooms suffer from chronic condensation and rust because heritage homes lack proper vapor barriers, leading to leaks, zone valve failures, and circulator pump corrosion after 20 to 25 years of service
    - Radiator systems designed for boiler supply temperatures of 75 to 80 degrees Celsius work poorly with high-efficiency condensing boilers that maximize efficiency at 50 to 60 degrees Celsius, requiring radiator upgrades or acceptance of lower efficiency to maintain adequate heat output
    - Heritage homes with multiple additions or renovations over decades often have undersized or improperly zoned boiler systems, leading to cold spots in newer sections and overheating in original rooms, and retrofitting proper zone controls requires electrical and plumbing work
    - Guelph's natural gas rates and provincial carbon pricing make boiler fuel costs a significant annual expense, and homeowners with boilers over 20 years old face efficiency losses that add $800 to $1,500 per year in fuel costs compared to modern condensing boilers
context: |
  Guelph's historic downtown core and established neighbourhoods like the Ward, St. Patrick's Ward, and Exhibition Park feature numerous century homes where boiler systems with radiators remain the preferred heating method. These heritage properties often have original cast iron radiators that homeowners wish to preserve, making boiler replacement rather than full system conversion the logical choice. The stone and brick construction common in Old University and Brooklyn-College Hill provides excellent thermal mass that pairs beautifully with radiant heat distribution. Many Guelph homeowners appreciate the quiet, even warmth that boilers provide compared to forced air systems, particularly in these older homes with plaster walls and hardwood floors where ductwork installation would be disruptive and costly.
proof:
  testimonial: "Our 1890s stone home in the Ward had the original boiler finally give out. B.A.P installed a new high-efficiency unit that works perfectly with our cast iron radiators. The house has never been warmer."
