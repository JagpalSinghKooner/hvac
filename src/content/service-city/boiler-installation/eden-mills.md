localContext: |
  Eden Mills' identity as Canada's first carbon-neutral village reflects a community deeply committed to energy efficiency, making high-efficiency boiler systems a natural choice for local homeowners. This small hamlet along the Eramosa River features historic mill buildings and heritage homes where boiler heating has provided warmth for generations. The community's environmental focus means residents often choose condensing boilers that achieve 95%+ efficiency, minimizing fuel consumption and emissions. Eden Mills' older properties include stone and brick construction that responds beautifully to radiant heat distribution from radiator systems. The surrounding rural properties feature custom homes and renovated farmhouses where in-floor radiant heating provides efficient, comfortable warmth. Eden Mills homeowners typically research heating options thoroughly and select boiler systems for their efficiency, longevity, and compatibility with the community's sustainability values.

  testimonial: "As part of Eden Mills commitment to carbon neutrality, we replaced our old boiler with the highest efficiency condensing unit available. B.A.P helped us select and install a system that aligns with our environmental values while keeping our historic home comfortable."
