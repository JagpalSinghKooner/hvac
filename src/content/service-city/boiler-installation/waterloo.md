localContext: |
  Waterloo's Uptown core and surrounding established neighbourhoods like Beechwood, MacGregor-Albert, and Westmount feature numerous homes with existing boiler heating systems. The mature tree-lined streets near the universities contain many mid-century and older properties where radiator heat remains the standard. Waterloo Park area homes and the historic Lakeshore neighbourhood showcase the solid construction and quality craftsmanship that pairs well with hydronic heating. Many Waterloo homeowners, including professors and professionals in heritage properties, appreciate the quiet operation and superior comfort of boiler systems compared to forced air alternatives. The newer executive homes in Vista Hills and Columbia Forest have also embraced in-floor radiant heating for its energy efficiency and luxurious feel. Waterloo's educated homeowner base often researches heating options thoroughly and chooses boilers for their efficiency and long-term reliability.
