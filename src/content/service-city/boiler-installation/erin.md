localContext: |
  Erin's small-town charm and rural Wellington County setting make boiler heating systems a practical choice for local properties. The village centre around Main Street contains heritage buildings and older homes where radiator systems provide comfortable, reliable heat. The surrounding countryside features farmhouses, estate properties, and custom rural homes where boiler systems excel at heating large spaces evenly. Many Erin residents have converted older farm buildings into workshops, studios, or living spaces where in-floor radiant heating provides the most practical solution. The cooler temperatures at this elevation compared to communities further south make reliable heating essential, and boilers deliver consistent warmth without the temperature fluctuations common with forced air systems. Erin's community of artisans, equestrians, and rural lifestyle enthusiasts often chooses hydronic heating for its quiet operation and superior comfort in both living spaces and functional outbuildings.

  testimonial: "We converted our century-old barn into a pottery studio and living space. B.A.P installed radiant floor heating that keeps the entire building comfortable even in the coldest weather. The consistent warmth is perfect for working with clay."
