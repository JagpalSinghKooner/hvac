localContext: |
  Hamilton's extensive inventory of century homes makes it one of the strongest markets for boiler heating systems in Southern Ontario. The Durand neighbourhood, Kirkendall, Westdale, and Locke Street areas feature block after block of Victorian, Edwardian, and Arts and Crafts homes where boilers and radiators have provided reliable heat for generations. The city's industrial heritage means solid brick construction with high ceilings and plaster walls that respond beautifully to radiant heat distribution. Hamilton Mountain neighbourhoods like Delta and Ainslie Wood also contain numerous boiler-heated properties from the early to mid-twentieth century. The ongoing revitalization of Hamilton has brought many young families into heritage properties where they discover the comfort benefits of boiler heat and choose to upgrade rather than convert their heating systems.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We fell in love with a Kirkendall Victorian but the boiler was original to the house. B.A.P designed a system that works with our ornate radiators and delivers incredible warmth. The house feels completely different now."
