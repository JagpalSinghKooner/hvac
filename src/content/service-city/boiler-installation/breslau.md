localContext: |
  Breslau's evolution from a quiet Mennonite farming community to a growing residential area has created diverse boiler heating needs. The original village core along Woolwich Street contains older homes where boiler systems with radiators have provided reliable heat for decades. The surrounding farmhouses and rural properties feature larger homes where boiler heating delivers the even, consistent warmth that forced air systems struggle to achieve in spacious floor plans. Breslau's newer developments attract families building custom homes who increasingly specify in-floor radiant heating for its comfort, efficiency, and invisible operation. The community's agricultural heritage means many properties include workshops, processing buildings, and heated outbuildings where hydronic systems provide practical, durable warmth. Breslau residents transitioning from farmhouse living to modern custom construction often maintain their preference for boiler heating based on positive experience with radiant systems.

  testimonial: "We grew up with radiator heat on the family farm and insisted on radiant flooring when we built our new home in Breslau. B.A.P designed a system with zones for each floor that provides incredible comfort. Best decision we made."
