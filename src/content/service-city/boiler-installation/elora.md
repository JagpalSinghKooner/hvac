localContext: |
  Elora's designation as one of Ontario's prettiest villages reflects its exceptional collection of nineteenth-century limestone and brick buildings, most of which feature boiler heating systems with radiators. The historic mill district along the Grand River gorge, Metcalfe Street, and the charming downtown core contain heritage properties where radiant heat has provided comfort for well over a century. Elora's artistic community and gallery district occupy many converted heritage buildings where owners maintain boiler systems to preserve architectural integrity. The village's strict heritage conservation guidelines mean homeowners cannot easily modify exteriors to add furnace vents, making boiler replacement the practical choice for many properties. The surrounding rural areas include estate homes and converted farm properties where hydronic heating provides superior comfort. Elora's unique character attracts homeowners committed to preservation who value contractors experienced with heritage heating systems.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our stone building on Mill Street has housed an art gallery for 30 years. When the old boiler failed, B.A.P installed a system that heats our high-ceilinged space evenly without visible modifications to the heritage facade. Exactly what we needed."
