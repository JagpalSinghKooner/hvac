localContext: |
  Fergus sits along the Grand River, and this proximity to water creates natural humidity conditions that affect homes throughout the community. The historic downtown features beautiful limestone buildings from the Scottish settlement era, but the same stone construction that gives Fergus its character also allows moisture to migrate through foundations. Many homes in established neighbourhoods near the river have basements that experience chronic dampness, particularly during spring when snowmelt raises the water table and during humid summer months. The Elora Gorge and Grand River Conservation Area nearby contribute to the region's elevated ambient humidity. Newer subdivisions in Fergus were built on former agricultural land with clay soil that holds moisture against foundations. The limestone bedrock underlying much of the area influences groundwater flow, with some properties experiencing seepage through foundation cracks where water finds pathways through the rock. Homeowners throughout Fergus notice musty basements, window condensation, and mold growth that indicate humidity levels exceeding the healthy 30-50% range. Whole-home dehumidification addresses these moisture challenges comprehensively.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our stone home near downtown Fergus had a basement so damp that mold grew on everything we stored there. The limestone walls seemed to sweat in summer. B.A.P installed a whole-home dehumidifier and the transformation has been incredible."
