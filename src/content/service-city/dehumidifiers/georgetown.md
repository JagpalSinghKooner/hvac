localContext: |
  Georgetown sits along the Credit River in Halton Hills, where the river valley creates natural humidity conditions that affect homes throughout this historic community. The river's presence means elevated groundwater levels and ambient humidity, particularly in neighbourhoods close to the water. Historic downtown Georgetown features heritage properties from the paper mill era with stone and brick foundations that allow moisture migration over time. Established residential areas surrounding the downtown core have homes from various eras, each with foundations that predate modern waterproofing standards to varying degrees. The heavy clay soil throughout Georgetown holds water against foundations and prevents proper drainage away from structures. Newer subdivisions built during Georgetown's significant residential growth were constructed on former agricultural land where drainage patterns were disrupted. The Credit River valley topography means humid air settles in lower areas during summer months, pushing indoor humidity well above comfortable levels. Many Georgetown homeowners notice persistent musty odors, window condensation, and mold growth in basements and closets that indicate humidity exceeding the healthy 30-50% range. Whole-home dehumidification addresses these moisture challenges comprehensively.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our home near the Credit River in Georgetown had such high basement humidity that mold kept returning no matter how often we cleaned. After mold remediation, B.A.P installed a whole-home dehumidifier to prevent recurrence. Three years and no mold problems since."
