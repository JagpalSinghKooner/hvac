localContext: |
  Shelburne's location in the Dufferin highlands means homeowners face some of the most demanding winter conditions in our entire service area. Temperatures here regularly drop lower than communities to the south, putting heat pumps through rigorous cold-weather operation that requires meticulous maintenance to sustain. The growing town has attracted families and professionals seeking small-town living within commuting distance of the GTA, many choosing heat pumps for their dual heating and cooling capabilities. Our technicians pay special attention to defrost system operation and refrigerant levels during Shelburne maintenance visits, knowing these factors are critical for reliable winter performance. From the historic core to new developments on the edges of town, we ensure every Shelburne heat pump is prepared for the challenging seasons ahead.
