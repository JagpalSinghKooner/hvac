localContext: |
  Hamilton's dramatic escarpment geography creates distinct climate zones that significantly impact heat pump performance. Homes on the Mountain experience different temperature and wind patterns than those in the lower city, and our technicians adjust their maintenance approach accordingly. The steel city's ongoing renaissance has brought renewed interest in energy-efficient heating and cooling, with heat pumps becoming increasingly popular in revitalized neighbourhoods like Westdale and Kirkendall. We understand how Hamilton's industrial legacy can affect outdoor unit maintenance requirements, with more frequent coil cleaning needed in certain areas. From the historic homes of Durand to new builds in Binbrook, our bi-annual maintenance program ensures Hamilton heat pumps deliver reliable year-round comfort regardless of which side of the escarpment you call home.
