localContext: |
  Brantford's position along the Grand River and its status as a growing regional centre have made it a community where heat pump adoption continues to rise. The Telephone City's mix of historic Victorian architecture downtown and modern developments in areas like Eagle Place and the west end creates diverse maintenance requirements for heat pump systems. The Grand River corridor brings humidity and temperature variations that affect outdoor unit performance, particularly during the critical defrost cycles in winter months. Our technicians have extensive experience with Brantford's housing stock and climate conditions, providing maintenance that addresses the specific challenges heat pumps face in this area. From older retrofitted homes to new energy-efficient builds, we ensure every Brantford heat pump receives the bi-annual care it needs.
