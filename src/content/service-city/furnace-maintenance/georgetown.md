localContext: |
  Georgetown serves as the largest community within Halton Hills, offering diverse housing from heritage downtown properties to contemporary subdivisions with varied furnace maintenance requirements. The historic Main Street area features beautifully preserved Victorian and Edwardian homes where heating systems must work within modified structures often lacking original ductwork provisions. Established neighbourhoods like Glen Williams border and the Delrex area have mature homes from the 1960s-1980s with furnaces typically 12-20 years old. Newer developments in areas like Hungry Hollow and Georgetown South have modern high-efficiency equipment requiring precision maintenance for optimal performance. The Credit River valley running through Georgetown creates microclimates with properties near the waterway experiencing higher humidity levels. Georgetown's position between the GTA and Guelph means many residents commute, relying on programmable thermostats that benefit from proper calibration. The escarpment proximity brings slightly cooler temperatures than lakeside communities. Schedule maintenance in September before fall brings increased demand. Common Georgetown findings include humidity control issues, heritage home airflow challenges, and condensate drainage problems in high-efficiency installations.
