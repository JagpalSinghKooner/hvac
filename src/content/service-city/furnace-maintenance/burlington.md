localContext: |
  Burlington homeowners benefit from the city's lakeside location which moderates extreme winter temperatures, but this proximity also brings humidity considerations for furnace maintenance. Established neighbourhoods like Roseland, Tyandaga, and Brant Hills feature mature homes from the 1960s-1980s with furnaces often reaching 15-20 years old. The Aldershot area includes older housing stock requiring careful attention to system compatibility during maintenance. Burlington's newer developments in Millcroft and along the Appleby corridor have modern high-efficiency furnaces that demand precision maintenance for optimal performance. The escarpment backdrop means properties at higher elevations experience slightly different heating demands than lakefront homes. Fall maintenance should be scheduled before Thanksgiving to beat the rush and ensure your system is ready for Burlington's typically mild but occasionally harsh winter weather. Common Burlington maintenance discoveries include condensate pump failures in basement installations, thermostat wire degradation in older homes, and dirty flame sensors causing ignition delays.
