localContext: |
  Orangeville's position at the headwaters of the Credit River and elevated terrain means residents experience some of the coldest winter temperatures in the GTA region. The town's blend of Victorian-era homes along Broadway and First Street with newer subdivisions in areas like Montgomery Village and Orangeville Heights creates diverse furnace maintenance requirements. Historic properties often feature updated heating systems installed in challenging configurations, while newer homes have modern high-efficiency equipment needing precision maintenance. The town's elevation contributes to earlier freeze dates and later thaws compared to lower-lying communities, extending the heating season into late October through mid-April. Many Orangeville properties have basements with dedicated recreation areas requiring consistent heat distribution from well-maintained furnace systems. Schedule maintenance by late September given the earlier onset of cold weather in this area. Common Orangeville maintenance findings include cold air infiltration issues in older homes, humidifier integration problems, and blower motor strain from extended heating seasons.
