localContext: |
  Caledon's sprawling rural municipality encompasses everything from the village centres of Caledon Village, Caledon East, and Inglewood to expansive estate properties and working farms. This diversity creates unique furnace maintenance considerations compared to urban communities. Many rural Caledon properties rely on propane rather than natural gas, requiring technicians experienced with propane system nuances. Estate homes often feature multiple heating zones or oversized equipment needing careful maintenance to ensure proper operation. The Niagara Escarpment running through the municipality creates microclimates with some areas experiencing significantly colder temperatures and greater snowfall. Properties with hobby farms or workshops may have auxiliary heating systems requiring coordinated maintenance. Caledon's distance from urban centres makes preventive maintenance particularly important to avoid emergency service challenges during winter storms. Schedule maintenance in early September before the fall rush affects availability for rural calls. Common Caledon findings include propane regulator issues, oversized equipment cycling problems, and wildlife interference with outdoor components.
