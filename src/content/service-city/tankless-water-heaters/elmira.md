problem:
  headline: 'Running Out of Hot Water in Busy Households'
  description: |
    Tank water heaters store 40-60 gallons of preheated water. Once that reserve depletes during morning showers or evening baths, you wait 30-45 minutes for recovery. Larger rural homes in Woolwich Township with multiple bathrooms face hot water conflicts when occupants shower simultaneously. Teenagers taking long showers drain tanks before parents finish morning routines. Guest visits strain hot water supply beyond what stored capacity provides.

    Heritage properties downtown often have undersized tank water heaters installed decades ago when homes had fewer bathrooms. Modern builds in newer subdivisions sometimes have builder-grade 40-gallon tanks inadequate for family hot water demand. Agricultural properties with cleanup needs after farm work require more hot water than standard residential tanks deliver. Running out of hot water mid-shower creates frustration that repeats every day.

    Tank systems waste energy maintaining stored water temperature 24 hours daily. Standby heat loss through tank insulation costs $150-$250 annually in natural gas even when you are not using hot water. Larger tanks required for adequate supply increase this standby loss. Tankless systems eliminate standby loss by heating water only on demand when you turn on the tap.
  issues:
    - 'Frequent hot water depletion during peak morning or evening usage periods'
    - 'Insufficient hot water capacity for homes with multiple bathrooms or occupants'
    - 'Standby energy loss from maintaining tank temperature around the clock'

solution:
  headline: 'On-Demand Water Heating for Unlimited Hot Water'
  description: |
    Tankless water heaters heat water instantly as it flows through the unit, eliminating stored water and recovery wait times. Proper sizing requires calculating maximum simultaneous hot water demand. We assess fixture count, bathroom usage patterns, and peak demand scenarios to determine required flow rate measured in gallons per minute at temperature rise. A home with three bathrooms typically needs 8-10 GPM capacity. Undersized units cannot maintain temperature when multiple fixtures run simultaneously.

    Installation requires adequate natural gas supply. Tankless units demand 150,000-200,000 BTU input compared to 40,000 BTU for tank heaters. Most Elmira homes need gas line upgrades from 1/2" to 3/4" pipe to supply sufficient fuel. We assess existing gas service, calculate pipe sizing, and coordinate Enbridge meter upgrades when required. Proper venting through exterior walls or roofs meets TSSA combustion air requirements. Installation includes water pressure regulation, scale prevention, and freeze protection for exterior installations.

    New tankless installations include manufacturer warranty on heat exchanger and components. We verify proper operation through startup, check temperature calibration across multiple flow rates, and document baseline performance. Located at 25 Clearview Street serving Elmira since 1994, we will be here when you need service or maintenance years from now.

trustOpener: 'Since 1994, B.A.P has been installing tankless water heaters across Elmira''s diverse properties, from century homes near downtown to modern builds in expanding subdivisions. Three decades and over 150 installations in Woolwich Township create pattern recognition. We know which gas line upgrades work for different home configurations, how hard well water affects heat exchanger longevity, and which equipment holds up best in small-town Ontario conditions. When you are investing $4,500-$7,500 in on-demand water heating, institutional knowledge matters.'

contextHeadline: 'Tankless Solutions for Woolwich Township Homes'
context: |
  Elmira''s rural location means many properties have hard well water with mineral content that forms scale inside tankless heat exchangers. Calcium and magnesium deposits reduce efficiency and eventually block flow passages. Annual descaling maintenance with citric acid solution removes scale buildup and maintains performance. Water softener installation prevents scale formation in homes with particularly hard water.

  Larger rural homes and agricultural properties benefit most from unlimited hot water capacity. Multiple bathrooms, larger families, and farm operations requiring cleanup create peak demand situations where tank systems fail. Woolwich Township building code requires proper gas line sizing and venting for tankless installations. Community values of quality work done right the first time align with installations that last 20+ years without premature failure.

  Waterloo North Hydro serves Elmira for electricity. Enbridge Gas provides natural gas service throughout Woolwich Township making gas-fired tankless heaters the most practical choice. Natural gas availability and lower fuel costs compared to propane or electricity favor high-BTU tankless systems. With 32 years and over 150 tankless installations serving Elmira, we understand gas line requirements and hard water challenges affecting these systems.
