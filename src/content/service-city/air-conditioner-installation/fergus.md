localContext: |
  Fergus combines Scottish heritage charm with growing residential development along the Grand River. The historic downtown features stone buildings and Victorian homes where AC installation must navigate older construction methods while delivering modern comfort. Established neighborhoods near the river contain a mix of heritage homes and mid-century construction with varying ductwork conditions. Growing areas to the north and west of town feature newer subdivisions with modern construction ready for efficient central air systems. The Grand River valley creates a humidity corridor that intensifies summer heat, making effective dehumidification essential. Fergus homeowners appreciate quality craftsmanship that respects their town's character while providing reliable comfort during increasingly warm Ontario summers.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our limestone Victorian near downtown Fergus needed careful handling. B.A.P worked with the thick stone walls and preserved our original plaster while installing a system that finally makes summers bearable. They treated our home with real respect."
