localContext: |
  Bolton serves as Caledon's largest urban centre, combining small-town character with suburban growth. The historic downtown along Queen Street features century homes and converted commercial buildings where AC installation requires balancing modern comfort with heritage preservation. Established neighborhoods surrounding the core contain a mix of housing ages and styles with varying ductwork infrastructure. Newer subdivisions expanding north and south of downtown feature contemporary homes built to modern energy standards, ideal for high-efficiency central air systems. Bolton's position in the Humber River valley creates localized humidity that intensifies summer heat. The community's growing families and professionals seek reliable, efficient cooling systems that provide consistent comfort throughout increasingly warm Southern Ontario summers.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We bought a 1970s split-level in Bolton that had no AC. B.A.P engineered a solution that worked with our unusual layout, running ductwork through closets and soffits. You'd never know it was a retrofit—the system works beautifully."
