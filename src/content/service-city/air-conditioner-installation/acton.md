localContext: |
  Acton's leather-tanning industrial heritage shaped a community with distinct housing stock now requiring modern comfort upgrades. The downtown core along Mill Street features heritage buildings and homes where AC installation must navigate older construction while preserving character. Established residential areas contain working-class homes from the early to mid-20th century with varying ductwork infrastructure and insulation levels. Newer developments on Acton's expanding edges offer modern construction ready for efficient central air systems. The Niagara Escarpment rises immediately west of town, creating terrain that affects local airflow and temperature patterns. Black Creek runs through the community, adding humidity that intensifies summer cooling demands throughout the town.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our former tanner's cottage downtown had such unique construction we thought AC was impossible. B.A.P found a solution using a combination of ductless units and minimal ductwork that keeps every room comfortable without destroying our home's character."
