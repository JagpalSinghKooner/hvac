localContext: |
  Waterloo combines historic charm with tech-driven growth, creating diverse AC installation needs across its neighborhoods. The Uptown core and surrounding areas like MacGregor-Albert and Lakeshore feature older homes where retrofit installations require careful planning around existing structures. Established neighborhoods such as Beechwood and Westmount have well-maintained mid-century homes that benefit from modern high-efficiency replacements. The city's significant tech sector population in newer areas like Vista Hills, Columbia Forest, and developments near Laurelwood often seek smart-home compatible systems with advanced humidity control. Waterloo's inland location experiences the full force of Southern Ontario's humid continental summers, with heat waves pushing temperatures into the mid-30s. The large student population means many properties benefit from zoned cooling systems that maximize efficiency in multi-bedroom layouts.
