localContext: |
  Eden Mills is a small historic village on the Eramosa River known for its tight-knit literary community and heritage character. The village features century homes and converted mill buildings where AC installation requires creative approaches to preserve architectural integrity. Riverside properties face elevated humidity levels that intensify summer cooling demands, particularly in homes with older construction less equipped for moisture management. The village's small size means most homes are heritage properties requiring careful assessment before installation. Eden Mills residents typically value environmental stewardship, reflected in the community's sustainability initiatives, making high-efficiency AC systems a natural fit. Access to the village via narrow rural roads means reliable equipment requiring minimal service visits is especially valuable.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1860s heritage home in Eden Mills had never had modern cooling. B.A.P designed a ductless system that provides room-by-room comfort without any visible impact on our home's historic character. The energy efficiency aligns with our village's sustainability values."
