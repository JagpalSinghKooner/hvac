localContext: |
  Breslau's transformation from a quiet farming village to a rapidly growing community has created diverse AC installation needs. The historic village core retains heritage homes and older construction requiring thoughtful retrofit approaches that balance modern comfort with existing character. Newer residential developments expanding north and east of the traditional village feature contemporary homes built to current energy codes, ideal for high-efficiency central air systems. The Grand River flows nearby, contributing humidity that intensifies summer heat throughout the community. Breslau's proximity to both Kitchener and Guelph makes it attractive to commuters seeking suburban living, and these homeowners expect reliable, efficient cooling systems that require minimal attention during busy lives.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We built in one of Breslau's new developments and wanted the best AC from day one. B.A.P helped us select a variable-speed system that integrates with our smart home setup. The app control is incredibly convenient and efficiency is excellent."
