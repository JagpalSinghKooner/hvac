localContext: |
  Elora's stunning location at the Grand River Gorge and its artistic community character create unique AC installation considerations. The village's heritage conservation district features limestone buildings and century homes where preserving architectural integrity is paramount. Mill Street and surrounding areas contain shops and residences in converted heritage structures requiring creative cooling solutions. Residential streets outside the core feature a mix of heritage homes and newer construction with varying installation requirements. The deep river gorge and surrounding limestone formations contribute to localized humidity and temperature variations throughout the village. Elora homeowners typically value environmental stewardship and seek efficient systems that minimize energy consumption while providing reliable summer comfort in this picturesque destination.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1850s stone home overlooking the gorge presented real challenges for AC installation. B.A.P designed a ductless system for the main floor and integrated central air upstairs that keeps our historic home comfortable without visible modifications."
