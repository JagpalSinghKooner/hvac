localContext: |
  Cambridge experiences Southern Ontario's characteristic humid summers, with the Grand River valley contributing additional moisture that intensifies the heat. The city's unique composition of three former towns—Galt, Preston, and Hespeler—means diverse housing types requiring different installation approaches. Historic mill worker homes in downtown Galt and Preston's core feature older construction that benefits from ductless mini-split systems or careful central air retrofits. Newer developments in areas like Hespeler Village and Blair Road accommodate conventional central air installations. The industrial heritage means many homes near former textile mills have unique layouts requiring custom ductwork solutions. Cambridge homeowners face July and August humidity that makes efficient dehumidification as important as cooling, making properly sized, modern AC systems essential for true summer comfort.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Living in an 1890s Victorian in downtown Galt, we thought central air was impossible. B.A.P found a way to route ductwork through our home without destroying the character. The humidity control alone has been life-changing."
