localContext: |
  Milton has experienced explosive growth, transforming from a small town into a thriving community with diverse housing requiring varied AC solutions. The historic downtown core retains charming older homes where retrofit installations need creative approaches to preserve character while delivering modern comfort. Rapidly expanding areas like Willmott, Harrison, Dorset Park, and developments near the 401 corridor feature new construction built to current energy codes, ideal for high-efficiency systems. Milton's position at the base of the Niagara Escarpment creates unique airflow patterns, with summer heat pooling in lower areas while Escarpment-adjacent homes catch cooling breezes. The town's young families prioritize energy efficiency and indoor air quality, making Milton homeowners excellent candidates for advanced AC systems featuring enhanced filtration and smart controls.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We moved to Milton from downtown Toronto and were shocked by how much hotter summers felt without lake breezes. B.A.P sized our system perfectly for our Harrison home—it handles heat waves without running constantly."
