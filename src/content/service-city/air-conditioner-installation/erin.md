localContext: |
  Erin's small-town atmosphere in the heart of Wellington County offers a retreat from urban life, though summers still demand reliable air conditioning. The village centre features heritage homes and buildings dating back to the town's founding, where AC installation requires thoughtful approaches that preserve historic character. Surrounding rural properties and hobby farms include larger homes on acreage requiring higher-capacity systems and longer ductwork runs. The Credit River headwaters nearby contribute to local humidity levels that make dehumidification an important consideration. Erin's elevation on the Niagara Escarpment provides some relief from extreme heat, but July and August still bring temperatures requiring active cooling for indoor comfort. The community's tight-knit character means homeowners rely on word-of-mouth recommendations for trusted service providers.

  testimonial: "Our stone farmhouse outside Erin village had thick walls that stayed cool in spring but trapped heat by August. B.A.P installed a system sized for our home's thermal mass that finally makes summers comfortable without overcooling in spring."
