localContext: |
  Orangeville's elevation on the Niagara Escarpment provides slightly cooler temperatures than lower-lying areas, but summers still bring substantial heat and humidity requiring reliable air conditioning. The charming downtown along Broadway features heritage buildings converted to residences and commercial spaces where creative AC solutions preserve architectural character. Established neighborhoods surrounding the downtown core contain a mix of century homes and mid-century construction with varying ductwork conditions. Newer developments in areas like Montgomery Village and the town's west end feature modern construction accommodating standard high-efficiency installations. The headwaters of the Credit River originate nearby, contributing to local humidity levels. Orangeville's position as the gateway to the Headwaters region attracts residents seeking small-town charm while maintaining proximity to the GTA, creating demand for modern comfort systems.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our brick century home on Broadway had been roasting every summer. B.A.P installed a high-efficiency system with minimal visible ductwork that keeps us cool without affecting the historic look. Visitors can't even tell we have central air."
