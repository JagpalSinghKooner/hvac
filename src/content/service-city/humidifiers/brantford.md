localContext: |
  Brantford's housing stock ranges from stately Victorian homes in the downtown core to modern developments in Eagle Place and the west end, and all face the same winter humidity challenge. The Telephone City's location along the Grand River provides no relief from the dry conditions that accompany Ontario's heating season. Historic homes with plaster walls and original woodwork are especially vulnerable to damage when indoor humidity drops below safe levels. Many Brantford families have noticed cracks appearing in drywall, gaps opening in hardwood floors, and increased respiratory complaints during the coldest months. The city's older homes often have original forced-air systems that are particularly efficient at stripping moisture from indoor air. A whole-home humidifier installation restores balance, protecting both heritage properties and newer homes from the damaging effects of dry winter air.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Victorian in downtown Brantford had serious issues with plaster cracking every winter. B.A.P diagnosed the problem as low humidity and installed a flow-through humidifier. Two winters later, no new cracks and the existing ones have stabilized."
