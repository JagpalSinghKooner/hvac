localContext: |
  Burlington homeowners invest significantly in their properties, from the executive homes of Millcroft and Tyandaga to the lakeside residences of Roseland and downtown. Protecting that investment means addressing the dry air problem that plagues Southern Ontario homes every winter. Despite Burlington's proximity to Lake Ontario, indoor humidity during heating season can plummet to uncomfortable and damaging levels. The city's many custom homes with hardwood flooring, built-in cabinetry, and high-end finishes are particularly susceptible to moisture-related damage including wood shrinkage, cracking, and warping. Burlington families also report that proper humidity control reduces the spread of airborne viruses and bacteria, keeping households healthier during cold and flu season. A whole-home humidifier is an essential component of any well-maintained Burlington residence.
