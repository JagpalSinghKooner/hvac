localContext: |
  Guelph homeowners understand the challenges of Ontario's harsh winter climate. When temperatures plunge and furnaces run constantly, indoor humidity levels can drop below 20%, creating an uncomfortable and potentially harmful environment. The historic stone homes in the Ward and older properties throughout the Royal City are particularly susceptible to dry air damage, with hardwood floors cracking and antique furniture suffering from moisture loss. Families across Guelph report increased respiratory issues, dry skin, and static electricity during the coldest months. A whole-home humidifier integrated with your existing HVAC system maintains optimal humidity between 35-45%, protecting your home investment while improving health and comfort for your entire household.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1920s home in the Ward had terrible dry air every winter. B.A.P installed a bypass humidifier that works perfectly with our furnace. No more cracking trim and we all sleep better now."
