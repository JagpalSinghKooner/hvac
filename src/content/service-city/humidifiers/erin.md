localContext: |
  Erin's small-town charm and rural character attract residents who appreciate quality of life, but winter brings significant dry air challenges. Located in the hills of Wellington County, Erin experiences colder temperatures and longer heating seasons than communities closer to the lake. The village's heritage homes and surrounding country properties often feature wood construction that is particularly sensitive to humidity fluctuations. Many Erin residents have home workshops, craft rooms, or studios where proper humidity is essential for woodworking, art, or musical instruments. The tight-knit community values self-sufficiency, and a whole-home humidifier provides reliable, maintenance-free humidity control without the hassle of portable units. Rural properties with larger homes need appropriately sized systems that can handle the demands of spacious floor plans while maintaining consistent comfort throughout the structure.
