localContext: |
  Milton has experienced tremendous growth, with new subdivisions in Boyne, Harrison, and Willmott featuring modern construction and efficient heating systems. However, these tight, well-insulated homes often trap dry air inside, creating humidity levels that can drop dangerously low during Ontario winters. Young families who have invested in Milton's growing community frequently notice dry skin, increased static, and recurring respiratory issues during the heating season. The town's newer homes typically feature open-concept designs with hardwood and laminate flooring that shows every gap and crack when humidity drops below acceptable levels. Milton's elevation near the Escarpment can mean even colder winter temperatures, pushing furnaces harder and drying air further. A whole-home humidifier integrates seamlessly with your modern HVAC system to maintain optimal moisture levels throughout your home.
