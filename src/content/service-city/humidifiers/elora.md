localContext: |
  Elora's picturesque village setting along the Grand River Gorge attracts artists, craftspeople, and families who appreciate its unique character. The historic stone buildings that house galleries and shops are matched by beautiful heritage homes throughout the community. These older structures, built from local limestone, require proper humidity levels to preserve their historic integrity and the valuable contents within. Artists and artisans in Elora know that paper, canvas, wood, and textiles all suffer when indoor humidity drops too low. The village's thriving arts community has learned that proper climate control is essential for both creating and preserving work. Winter visitors to the gorge return to homes that should be comfortable sanctuaries, not environments that damage their belongings and health. A whole-home humidifier maintains the optimal conditions that Elora's creative residents and their historic homes deserve.
localProof:
  testimonial: "As a watercolour artist in Elora, dry winter air was ruining my paper stock and causing paint to behave unpredictably. B.A.P installed a bypass humidifier that keeps my studio at perfect working conditions. My materials last longer and my work has improved."
