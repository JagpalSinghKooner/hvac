localContext: |
  Bolton has grown significantly, blending its historic village character with new residential developments that attract young families seeking space and community. Whether you live in an established home near downtown Bolton or a newer property in the surrounding developments, dry winter air is an unavoidable challenge. The Humber River valley location does little to mitigate the moisture-stripping effects of constant furnace operation during Ontario's cold months. Bolton families frequently report that children suffer from persistent dry coughs, chapped skin, and disrupted sleep during heating season. Newer homes with tight building envelopes can actually trap dry air inside, making humidity control even more critical. Older Bolton properties with original hardwood floors and wooden trim face visible damage when humidity drops. A whole-home humidifier installation addresses these concerns for the entire household.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our kids were constantly sick every winter in our Bolton home. The pediatrician suggested checking our humidity, which was only 18 percent. B.A.P installed a humidifier and this winter has been completely different. The whole family is healthier."
