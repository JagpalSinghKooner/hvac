localContext: |
  Waterloo homeowners know that winter means months of battling dry indoor air. The tech hub's mix of uptown heritage properties and suburban family homes in Beechwood, Lakeshore, and Laurelwood all contend with humidity that can drop to 15% during cold snaps. University students and young professionals renting in the city often accept dry air as normal, but established homeowners understand the long-term damage it causes to property and health. Dry winter air in Waterloo contributes to cracked drywall, peeling paint, warped hardwood, and increased susceptibility to colds and flu. With many residents working from home, indoor air quality has become a priority. A whole-home humidifier maintains optimal moisture levels automatically, protecting your investment and your family's wellbeing throughout the heating season.
