localContext: |
  Orangeville's location at the headwaters of the Credit River means higher elevation and colder winter temperatures than many Southern Ontario communities. This translates to longer heating seasons and more severe indoor humidity depletion. The charming downtown with its heritage brick buildings and the established residential areas throughout town all suffer from dry air conditions that can damage property and impact health. Orangeville families often rely on their homes as sanctuaries during long winters, making indoor air quality a priority. The town's mix of older homes and newer developments in areas like Montgomery Village all benefit from whole-home humidification. Wood furniture, musical instruments, and artwork all require stable humidity levels that only a properly sized whole-home system can provide consistently throughout Orangeville's extended heating season.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Orangeville winters are brutal on indoor air. We had portable humidifiers everywhere but could not keep up. B.A.P installed a bypass humidifier and now one unit handles the whole house. Should have done this years ago."
