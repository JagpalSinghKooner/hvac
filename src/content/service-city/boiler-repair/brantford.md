localContext: |
  Brantford's manufacturing heritage has left a legacy of well-built older homes throughout neighbourhoods like Eagle Place, West Brant, and the downtown core where hydronic boiler heating remains common. Many homes built during Brantford's industrial boom from the 1890s through the 1950s feature cast iron radiators and boiler systems designed for reliable cold weather performance. The Grand River runs through the city, and homes near the waterfront areas experience higher humidity that can accelerate corrosion in older boiler piping and components. Common Brantford boiler issues include heat exchanger problems from the region's hard water, failed aquastats on older equipment, and circulation problems in homes with extensive radiator networks. The city's affordable housing stock attracts families who inherit these older heating systems and need reliable repair service. Downtown Brantford's heritage buildings often have original boiler rooms requiring technicians familiar with vintage equipment. Emergency boiler repair is critical when Brantford's winter temperatures drop and families depend on consistent heating for safety and comfort.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Eagle Place home is over 100 years old with the original boiler system. When it stopped igniting, B.A.P came out on a Sunday and replaced the gas valve. No overtime charge and we had heat before bedtime."
