localContext: |
  Guelph's historic downtown and established neighbourhoods like the Ward, St. George's Park, and Exhibition Park feature many homes built between 1880 and 1960 that rely on hydronic boiler heating systems. These older properties often have cast iron radiators fed by boilers that have served faithfully for decades. Common issues we encounter in Guelph include aging circulator pumps, corroded expansion tanks, and pressure relief valve failures. The limestone-heavy water in this region accelerates mineral buildup inside boiler heat exchangers, reducing efficiency and causing kettling sounds. University of Guelph area rentals frequently have boiler systems that see heavy use during the academic year. Emergency boiler repair is critical during Guelph's cold winters when temperatures regularly drop below minus twenty degrees, making a functioning heating system essential for home safety and preventing frozen pipes.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1920s home in the Ward has an old boiler that started leaking on the coldest night of the year. B.A.P had a technician here within two hours and fixed the pressure relief valve. Saved us from a freezing disaster."
