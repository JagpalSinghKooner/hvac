localContext: |
  Georgetown combines historic downtown character with established residential neighbourhoods where boiler heating systems have long been chosen for their comfort and reliability. The downtown Main Street area features heritage buildings and nearby homes from the late 1800s and early 1900s with original hydronic heating systems featuring cast iron radiators. Established areas like Glen Williams and the older sections of Georgetown have homes from various eras, many with hot water heating that provides even, comfortable warmth. The Credit River corridor creates microclimates throughout the community with cooler temperatures in valley areas. Common Georgetown boiler problems include hard water scale from the limestone bedrock, zone valve failures in multi-level homes, and expansion tank pre-charge loss. Newer custom homes occasionally feature radiant floor heating powered by high-efficiency condensing boilers. Georgetown's proximity to Toronto means many residents work from home and depend on reliable heating throughout the workday. Emergency boiler service is critical for Georgetown families when winter temperatures drop and consistent warmth becomes essential for daily life.
