localContext: |
  Caledon's sprawling rural landscape and estate properties make it home to some of the most sophisticated boiler heating systems in the region. Executive homes throughout Caledon East, Palgrave, Inglewood, and the Caledon Hills often feature multi-zone hydronic systems with radiant floor heating, dedicated domestic hot water production, and even snow melt systems for driveways and walkways. These complex installations require technicians who understand outdoor reset controls, variable speed pumping, and integration with home automation systems. Older farmhouses scattered throughout the township often retain original boiler systems from the mid-twentieth century that provide reliable radiator heat. Common Caledon boiler issues include glycol maintenance for outdoor systems, mixing valve adjustments for radiant floors, and control communication problems between zones. The rolling hills and higher elevation mean Caledon experiences colder temperatures and more snow than surrounding communities, making reliable boiler operation essential. Emergency service is critical for estate properties where heating system failure can affect valuable homes and their contents.

  testimonial: "Our Palgrave estate has a complex boiler setup with radiant floors and a snow melt system. When the primary secondary piping developed problems, B.A.P diagnosed and repaired it properly. They understand sophisticated hydronic systems."
