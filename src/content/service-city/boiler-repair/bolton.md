localContext: |
  Bolton serves as the urban centre of Caledon, combining small-town character with growing residential development where boiler heating systems serve both heritage homes and modern properties. The historic downtown along Queen Street features commercial buildings and nearby residences from the late 1800s and early 1900s with original hydronic heating systems still in operation. Established Bolton neighbourhoods built during the 1960s through 1980s often have hot water baseboard heating that provides comfortable, even warmth throughout winter. Newer developments in north Bolton occasionally include radiant floor heating powered by high-efficiency condensing boilers. Common Bolton boiler problems include air locks in older radiator systems, expansion tank pre-charge failures, and zone valve motor burnout. The Humber River valley location means Bolton experiences temperature inversions and cold air pooling during winter nights, increasing heating demands. Emergency boiler repair service ensures Bolton families maintain comfortable home temperatures when Ontario winter conditions are at their most demanding.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 1970s Bolton home has baseboard heating throughout. When we noticed uneven heat between rooms, B.A.P balanced the system and replaced a faulty zone valve. Every room heats evenly now."
