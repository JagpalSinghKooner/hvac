localContext: |
  Milton has experienced tremendous growth over the past two decades, creating a diverse mix of boiler heating systems across the town. The historic downtown core along Main Street features century homes with original hot water radiator heating that has warmed families for generations. Meanwhile, newer developments in Willmott, Harrison, and Scott feature modern homes where some builders have installed high-efficiency condensing boilers for radiant floor heating. Milton's location at the base of the Niagara Escarpment means homes experience cooler temperatures than nearby lakefront communities, increasing heating demands during winter months. Common boiler issues in Milton include air infiltration in older radiator systems, pressure fluctuations in newer installations, and control board failures on modern equipment. The rural properties around Campbellville and the escarpment areas often have larger homes with substantial boiler systems serving multiple heating zones. Emergency boiler repair is essential for Milton families when winter temperatures drop and reliable heat becomes critical for home comfort and safety.

  testimonial: "Our historic Main Street home has a boiler system that is probably 60 years old. B.A.P diagnosed a failing pressure reducing valve and replaced it along with the expansion tank. The system runs better than it has in years."
