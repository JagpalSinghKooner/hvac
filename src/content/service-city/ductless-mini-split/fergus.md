localContext: |
  Fergus combines Scottish heritage architecture with modern development, creating diverse opportunities for ductless mini split installations. The historic downtown along St. Andrew Street features beautiful stone buildings, many converted to residential use, where traditional ductwork installation would damage irreplaceable masonry and heritage features. The established residential areas include numerous century homes built with radiator heating systems that leave no practical path to central air conditioning. Mini splits provide these homeowners with efficient climate control without structural modifications. The Grand River runs through Fergus, and riverside properties often include additions, sunrooms, and converted spaces that existing HVAC systems cannot adequately condition. Newer developments on the edges of town feature multi-level homes where third floors and bonus rooms commonly experience temperature extremes. Fergus's craft and artisan community includes many residents with workshops and studios in converted outbuildings requiring independent climate control. The proximity to Elora creates a vibrant arts scene with home-based galleries and creative spaces that benefit from precise temperature and humidity management. Our technicians appreciate Fergus's architectural character and install systems that complement both heritage and contemporary homes.

  testimonial: "Our stone home on the Grand River had no way to add AC without destroying century-old walls. B.A.P installed mini splits that cool beautifully without any damage to the heritage stonework. Best decision we have made for this home."
