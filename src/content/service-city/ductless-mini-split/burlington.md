seoDescription: 'Ductless mini split installation in Burlington, ON. Perfect for additions and problem rooms. Serving Burlington since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Burlington's lakeside location and established residential neighbourhoods create ideal conditions for ductless mini split installations. The city's proximity to Lake Ontario produces humid summers that mini splits handle efficiently through integrated dehumidification. Older homes in Downtown Burlington, Roseland, and the Orchard district often feature hot water radiator systems with no existing ductwork, making mini splits the most practical solution for adding air conditioning. The Alton Village and Millcroft areas feature larger homes where certain rooms like bonus rooms over garages, sunrooms, and master bedroom additions fall outside the reach of central systems. Burlington's executive homes frequently include home offices and in-law suites that benefit from independent temperature control. The escarpment-adjacent properties in Tyandaga experience different microclimates than lakefront homes, and zone control allows homeowners to address these variations. Our Burlington installation teams work throughout the city, from the heritage properties near Spencer Smith Park to the modern developments in Alton, ensuring each system is properly sized and positioned for the specific application.

  testimonial: "Our lakefront home stays humid all summer despite central AC. B.A.P added mini splits to our sunroom and master bedroom, and the difference is remarkable. Both rooms are now comfortable and the humidity issues are gone."
