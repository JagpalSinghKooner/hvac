localContext: |
  Georgetown's blend of historic charm and modern convenience makes ductless mini splits an increasingly popular choice among homeowners. The downtown core along Main Street features heritage buildings converted to residential use where traditional ductwork installation would be impractical or would compromise architectural character. The established residential neighbourhoods include many homes built before central air conditioning became standard, where radiator or baseboard heating systems leave no easy path to whole-home cooling. Mini splits provide efficient climate control without invasive modifications. Georgetown's commuter population has driven demand for home office climate control, where a single-zone mini split maintains productivity without conditioning unused rooms. The Silver Creek and Credit View areas include larger homes with bonus rooms, finished basements, and additions that fall outside the effective range of central systems. Properties near the escarpment experience elevation-based temperature variations that zone control addresses effectively. Georgetown's growth has brought newer developments where builder-grade HVAC often cannot keep upper floors comfortable. Our technicians serve all of Georgetown, from heritage downtown properties to modern subdivisions.
