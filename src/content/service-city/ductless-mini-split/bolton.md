localContext: |
  Bolton's mix of established residential areas and newer developments creates diverse opportunities for ductless mini split installations. The historic downtown along Queen Street features older homes and converted commercial spaces where traditional ductwork installation would be challenging. Many of Bolton's mature neighbourhoods include homes built before air conditioning became standard, where radiator or baseboard heating systems leave no easy path to central cooling. Mini splits provide these homeowners with efficient heating and cooling without the expense and disruption of ductwork installation. Bolton's growth has brought newer subdivisions where bonus rooms over garages, three-storey designs, and basement conversions often fall outside the effective range of builder-grade HVAC systems. The surrounding rural properties on the edges of Bolton include workshops, studios, and home offices in accessory buildings that require independent climate control. Bolton's commuter population appreciates energy-efficient solutions, and modern mini splits with heat pump technology deliver significant savings over resistance heating. Our technicians serve all of Bolton, sizing and installing systems for optimal performance in each specific application.

  testimonial: "Our three-storey Bolton home was always uncomfortable on the top floor. The builder said it was normal. B.A.P installed a mini split for the third floor and now it is actually the most comfortable level in the house."
