problem:
  headline: 'Adding Climate Control Without Altering Heritage Features'
  description: 'Heritage homes in St. Jacobs present challenges that make traditional forced-air systems impractical or impossible. Century-old buildings lack plenum space for ductwork—ceiling heights were built for aesthetics, not HVAC distribution. Adding ducts means tearing into original plaster walls, cutting through hand-hewn beams, or building bulkheads that destroy period proportions. Even when technically possible, the renovation disruption often exceeds what homeowners will accept—weeks of dust, debris, and contractors accessing every room. Second-floor additions or renovations in heritage homes rarely include duct pathways, leaving those spaces without climate control tied to the existing system. Window air conditioners provide cooling but look terrible in heritage facades, create noise, waste energy, and offer no heating capacity. For village properties where architectural character drives property values, adding climate control shouldn''t require sacrificing the features that make these homes desirable.'
  issues:
    - 'Heritage construction lacks plenum space for traditional ductwork installation'
    - 'Adding forced-air systems requires invasive renovations that damage original features'
    - 'Room additions and upper floors often have no connection to existing HVAC distribution'

solution:
  headline: 'Flexible Ductless Systems for Historic Village Homes'
  description: 'Ductless mini-split systems deliver heating and cooling without ductwork modifications—making them ideal for St. Jacobs heritage properties. Each indoor unit mounts high on a wall, connects to an outdoor compressor through a small refrigerant line that runs through a 3-inch hole, and provides independent climate control for that space. A single outdoor unit supports multiple indoor heads, allowing zone control that conditions only occupied rooms rather than heating or cooling the entire property. Installation takes one to two days with minimal disruption—no tearing into walls, no ductwork modifications, and no extended renovation mess. For heritage homes, we position outdoor units away from primary facades to maintain curb appeal, route refrigerant lines through inconspicuous paths like closet interiors or basement rim joists, and mount indoor heads where they provide effective coverage without dominating room aesthetics. Modern ductless systems heat effectively to -25°C, making them suitable for St. Jacobs winters—many homeowners use them as primary heating for additions, supplement existing systems in difficult-to-condition spaces, or replace entire forced-air systems where ductwork is impractical. Zone control reduces energy waste by conditioning only occupied rooms, and inverter technology delivers precise temperature control with minimal cycling. For heritage properties where preservation and comfort both matter, ductless systems provide modern HVAC capability without architectural compromise.'

trustOpener: 'Since 1994, B.A.P has installed ductless mini-split systems in St. Jacobs heritage properties, from century homes downtown to converted village buildings throughout Woolwich Township. Three decades and over 175 installations teach you how to balance modern comfort with architectural preservation—where to position outdoor units that maintain curb appeal, how to route refrigerant lines through heritage structures without damaging original features, and how to select systems that provide reliable heating in Ontario winters. When you are adding climate control to a property valued for its architectural character, installation approach matters as much as equipment selection.'

context: |
  St. Jacobs heritage homes create ideal conditions for ductless system adoption—century-old construction without plenum space, original plaster walls that homeowners won''t tear into for ductwork, and architectural character that window air conditioners degrade. Many village properties have room additions, finished attics, or renovated upper floors that lack connections to existing forced-air systems—ductless provides climate control for these spaces without extensive renovations. Historic downtown buildings converted to residential use particularly benefit from ductless flexibility—you can condition living spaces without the ductwork modifications that traditional systems require.

  The village''s heritage preservation values mean homeowners want modern comfort without sacrificing architectural integrity. Outdoor unit placement becomes critical in a tourist destination where curb appeal affects property values—condensers visible from Main Street or positioned where they dominate facades undermine the heritage aesthetics that attract residents and visitors. We position equipment on side or rear elevations, use landscaping for screening when appropriate, and ensure installations respect the building character that defines village identity.

With 32 years and over 175 installations serving St. Jacobs, we understand how heritage architecture and village aesthetics affect ductless system requirements.

savings:
  headline: 'Efficient Heating and Cooling With Rebate Opportunities'
  description: 'Ductless systems typically cost $3,500-$12,000 depending on number of zones and capacity—comparable to window air conditioners and baseboard heaters for multiple rooms, but with far better efficiency and year-round capability. Heat pump operation costs approximately 30-40% less than electric baseboard heating for the same heat output, and far less than heating with window air conditioning running in reverse. Zone control reduces waste by conditioning only occupied spaces—heat your bedroom at night without paying to heat unused guest rooms, or cool second-floor living areas without overcooling the main floor. For additions or renovations where extending ductwork would cost $8,000-15,000, ductless provides modern comfort at lower installation cost. Save on Energy rebates up to $6,200 offset equipment costs for qualifying heat pump systems, improving return on investment. Operating efficiency pays ongoing dividends through reduced electricity bills compared to baseboard heating or window units.'

  testimonial: 'We added a second-floor master suite to our 1890 house but couldn''t extend the existing ductwork without major renovations we didn''t want to tackle. B.A.P installed a ductless system—outdoor unit on the side of the house where it''s barely visible, one head in the bedroom and one in the bathroom. The installation took one day, made minimal mess, and we now have perfect climate control upstairs year-round. The Save on Energy rebate covered nearly half the cost.'
