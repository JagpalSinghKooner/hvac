localContext: |
  Shelburne's position as the heart of Dufferin County makes it home to diverse properties where ductless mini splits provide practical heating and cooling solutions. The historic downtown features older commercial and residential buildings where traditional ductwork installation would be challenging or impossible. Many Shelburne homes were built with oil, propane, or wood heating systems and have no existing ductwork for air conditioning. Mini splits allow these homeowners to add efficient heating and cooling without major renovations. Shelburne's elevation makes it one of the cooler communities in southern Ontario, and heat pump mini splits excel at providing efficient heating even in sub-zero temperatures. The surrounding agricultural land includes numerous properties with workshops, home offices, and converted outbuildings requiring independent climate control. Shelburne's growing population includes young families who have converted basements and attics into additional living space where zone control proves valuable. The town's commuter population appreciates energy-efficient solutions that reduce monthly utility costs. Our technicians serve Shelburne and surrounding Dufferin County, understanding the specific challenges of heating and cooling in this higher-elevation community.
