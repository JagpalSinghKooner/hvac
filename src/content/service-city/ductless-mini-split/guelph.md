trustOpener: 'B.A.P has been installing ductless mini-split systems in Guelph since before they were common in Ontario, particularly in heritage homes where adding ductwork would compromise original architecture. Guelph''s downtown limestone homes and century properties are ideal candidates for ductless solutions. We understand the placement strategies that deliver even heating and cooling without visible equipment dominating your historic interiors.'
problem:
  headline: Heating and Cooling Additions Without Ductwork
  description: Guelph heritage homes, garage conversions, and home office additions often lack ductwork, leaving homeowners with choices between expensive duct retrofits that compromise original architecture, window air conditioners that are unsightly and inefficient, or space heaters that cost $150 to $300 per month to operate. Ductless mini-splits deliver heating and cooling without ductwork using indoor wall units connected to outdoor compressors, but poor placement, inadequate sizing, or single-zone systems in multi-room additions lead to uneven temperatures and wasted capacity.
  issues:
    - Heritage limestone homes in the Ward and downtown core have 18-inch to 24-inch thick walls that make duct retrofits prohibitively expensive (often $8,000 to $15,000) and compromise original plaster and trim, but mini-splits require only 3-inch penetrations for refrigerant lines
    - Finished basements and attic conversions in older Guelph homes often have 8-foot or lower ceilings where traditional ductwork cannot fit, and mini-split indoor units mounted high on walls deliver better air circulation than floor-level baseboards or radiators
    - Single-zone mini-split systems installed in open-concept additions or multi-room spaces struggle to distribute air evenly, leaving bedrooms or offices 3 to 5 degrees warmer or cooler than living areas, and multi-zone systems with individual room control cost more upfront but deliver better comfort and efficiency
    - Outdoor mini-split compressors installed in Guelph's cold climate need proper refrigerant line insulation and elevated mounting to prevent snow and ice buildup, and contractors without cold-climate experience often install them at ground level where winter conditions reduce performance and lifespan
context: |
  Guelph's eclectic mix of architectural styles makes ductless mini splits an ideal heating and cooling solution for many homeowners. The historic stone homes in the Ward and Downtown area often lack ductwork entirely, and retrofitting traditional HVAC would damage original plaster walls and heritage features. Mini splits provide efficient climate control without invasive installation. Many University of Guelph area properties have been converted from single-family homes to multi-unit rentals, where zone control allows individual temperature preferences in each unit. The city's commitment to sustainability aligns perfectly with mini split technology, as these systems achieve SEER ratings up to 30 and qualify for various rebate programs. South End additions and sunroom conversions are particularly well-suited for ductless systems, as extending existing ductwork often proves impractical. Our Guelph technicians regularly install mini splits in Kortright Hills home offices, Exhibition Park basement conversions, and St. Patrick's Ward attic bedrooms where traditional heating falls short.
proof:
  testimonial: "We added a home office above our detached garage and heating it seemed impossible. B.A.P installed a single-zone mini split that keeps it comfortable year-round. Our energy bills barely changed, and we use the office every day now."
