localContext: |
  Brantford's revitalized downtown and growing residential areas make it an excellent market for energy-efficient heat pump installations. Brantford Power provides reliable electrical service throughout the city with rates that make heat pump operation economical. The Grand River corridor creates a slightly moderated microclimate, though Brantford still experiences typical Southern Ontario winters with temperatures dropping to -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C handle these conditions reliably. Historic homes in the West Brant and Eagle Place neighborhoods benefit from ductless systems that avoid disrupting original architecture. Growing areas like Paris Road, Brier Park, and the Highway 403 corridor feature newer homes well-suited for ducted heat pump systems. Brantford homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. With Brantford's housing remaining more affordable than neighbouring cities, heat pump rebates cover a significant portion of installation costs, while typical savings of 35-45% on heating costs provide ongoing value.
localProof:
  testimonial: "When our old furnace failed, B.A.P recommended a heat pump as the replacement. Our West Brant home now has efficient heating and air conditioning we never had before. The rebates covered almost a third of the installation, and our monthly bills are lower than just heating used to cost."
