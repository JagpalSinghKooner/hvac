localContext: |
  Halton Hills encompasses Georgetown, Acton, and surrounding rural communities, each with distinct heating needs well-served by heat pump technology. Halton Hills Hydro provides reliable electrical service throughout the municipality, supporting residential heat pump installations. The area's elevation on the Niagara Escarpment means winters can be several degrees colder than lakeshore communities—our cold-climate heat pumps operate efficiently to -25°C and below. Rural properties between Georgetown and Acton often rely on propane or oil heating, making heat pumps an excellent upgrade path with significant cost savings. Historic downtown Georgetown features character homes ideal for ductless mini-split retrofits, while newer developments in Georgetown South and Acton's subdivisions suit ducted systems perfectly. Halton Hills homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. For rural properties converting from propane, savings often exceed 50% on heating costs. The municipality's commitment to environmental stewardship aligns perfectly with heat pump technology's reduced carbon footprint.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our rural property near Georgetown was heated with propane, which was expensive and inconvenient. B.A.P installed a cold-climate heat pump that has virtually eliminated our propane use. The savings are substantial, and we no longer worry about propane deliveries in winter."
