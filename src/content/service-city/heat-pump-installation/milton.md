localContext: |
  Milton's rapid growth has brought modern, energy-efficient homes ideally suited for heat pump technology. Milton Hydro provides robust electrical infrastructure designed to support the town's expanding residential base. Nestled against the Niagara Escarpment, Milton experiences slightly cooler winters than lakeside communities, with temperatures regularly dropping below -15°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure reliable heating throughout the season. Historic Old Milton features charming homes where ductless systems offer retrofit flexibility. Newer neighborhoods like Willmott, Harrison, Scott, and Dempsey present excellent opportunities for integrated ducted heat pump systems from initial construction or as furnace replacements. Milton homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The town's young families appreciate heat pump benefits: lower operating costs (typically 35-45% savings), reduced environmental impact, and the convenience of combined heating and cooling from a single system. Milton's newer housing stock often features upgraded electrical panels, simplifying heat pump installation.

  testimonial: "We moved to Milton for family-friendly living and wanted an eco-friendly home. B.A.P installed our heat pump when we replaced our builder-grade furnace. The system handles both heating and cooling beautifully, and the rebates made upgrading affordable."
