localContext: |
  Guelph's commitment to environmental sustainability makes it one of Ontario's most heat pump-friendly communities. The city's Community Energy Initiative actively promotes heat pump adoption, and Guelph Hydro (now Alectra Utilities) offers competitive time-of-use rates that maximize heat pump savings. Guelph's climate sees winter temperatures regularly dropping to -15°C to -20°C, making cold-climate heat pumps essential—our installations are rated to -25°C and beyond. Older homes in the Ward, Downtown, and St. Patrick's Ward benefit significantly from ductless mini-split options, while newer developments in the South End and Hanlon Creek Business Park are ideal for central ducted systems. Guelph homeowners typically see 35-45% reductions in heating costs when switching from natural gas, with the Canada Greener Homes Grant providing up to $7,100 to offset installation costs. The university community has driven strong demand for efficient, eco-friendly heating solutions across all neighborhoods.

  testimonial: "Our Victorian home in the Ward was expensive to heat with gas. B.A.P installed a cold-climate heat pump that handles our Ontario winters perfectly. Our first winter bill was almost half what we paid before, and we got $6,500 in rebates."
