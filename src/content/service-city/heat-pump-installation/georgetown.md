localContext: |
  Georgetown, as the largest community in Halton Hills, offers diverse housing stock ideally suited for heat pump technology. Halton Hills Hydro provides excellent electrical infrastructure throughout Georgetown, supporting the growing interest in electrified heating solutions. Located along the Niagara Escarpment, Georgetown experiences typical Southern Ontario winters with temperatures reaching -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure reliable performance throughout the season. Historic downtown Georgetown features character homes along Main Street where ductless mini-splits offer retrofit flexibility. Established neighborhoods like Glen Williams and Hungry Hollow suit various heat pump configurations. Growing areas in Georgetown South present excellent opportunities for ducted systems in newer construction. Georgetown homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's mix of young families and established residents appreciate heat pump benefits: combined heating and cooling, significant energy savings (typically 35-45%), and reduced environmental impact compared to natural gas.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We chose Georgetown for its small-town feel and wanted our home to reflect our environmental values. B.A.P installed a heat pump that has exceeded our expectations—comfortable year-round with significantly lower energy bills. The rebate process was smooth and the savings are ongoing."
