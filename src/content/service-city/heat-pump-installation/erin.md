localContext: |
  Erin's rural setting in the Headwaters region makes it an ideal community for heat pump adoption, particularly for properties currently relying on propane or oil heating. Hydro One serves Erin and surrounding areas with electrical infrastructure supporting heat pump installations. Located at higher elevation than much of Southern Ontario, Erin experiences colder winters with temperatures regularly dropping below -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps are rated to -25°C specifically for these conditions. The historic village center features charming homes where ductless mini-splits preserve character while delivering modern efficiency. Rural properties along Trafalgar Road, Winston Churchill Boulevard, and surrounding concessions often heat with propane, making heat pump conversion extremely attractive with potential savings exceeding 50%. Erin homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's appreciation for rural living and environmental stewardship aligns perfectly with heat pump technology's clean, efficient operation.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Living rurally near Erin meant expensive propane heating. B.A.P installed a cold-climate heat pump that has transformed our energy costs. We still have propane backup but barely use it—the heat pump works efficiently even in January cold snaps. Our annual savings have been remarkable."
