localContext: |
  Burlington's location along Lake Ontario provides slightly moderated winter temperatures compared to inland communities, enhancing heat pump efficiency during shoulder seasons. Burlington Hydro delivers reliable electrical service with modern infrastructure ideal for heat pump installations. While lakefront areas like Roseland and LaSalle Park benefit from lake-effect moderation, north Burlington communities near the escarpment experience colder temperatures—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure consistent performance across all neighborhoods. Established areas like Aldershot, Tyandaga, and Brant Hills feature mature homes where ductless mini-splits offer efficient retrofit options. Newer developments in Burlington North and Millcroft are well-suited for integrated ducted systems. Burlington homeowners qualify for up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The city's affluent homeowners appreciate heat pump technology's environmental benefits alongside typical savings of 35-45% on heating costs, eliminating natural gas dependence while maintaining year-round comfort.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our executive home in Millcroft was expensive to heat and cool. B.A.P installed a multi-zone heat pump system that replaced both our furnace and AC. The rebates covered nearly a third of the cost, and our energy bills dropped dramatically."
