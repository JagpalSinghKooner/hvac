localContext: |
  Shelburne's location in Dufferin County at higher elevation means colder winters than many Southern Ontario communities, making cold-climate heat pump technology essential. Hydro One serves Shelburne and surrounding rural areas with electrical infrastructure capable of supporting heat pump installations. Winter temperatures regularly drop below -20°C in Shelburne, which is why we install heat pumps specifically rated to -25°C and beyond—these are not the heat pumps of previous generations that struggled in cold weather. Historic downtown Shelburne features older homes where ductless mini-splits provide efficient retrofit options. Newer subdivisions on the east and north edges of town are well-suited for ducted systems. Rural properties surrounding Shelburne often heat with propane, making heat pump conversion extremely cost-effective with savings frequently exceeding 50%. Shelburne homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's practical, value-conscious residents appreciate heat pump benefits: significant energy savings, year-round comfort, and reduced dependence on propane or natural gas.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Shelburne winters are serious, so we needed a heating system that could handle the cold. B.A.P installed a cold-climate heat pump that has never let us down—even during the coldest nights last winter. Our heating costs dropped by nearly half, and we now have air conditioning too."
