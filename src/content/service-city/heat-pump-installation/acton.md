localContext: |
  Acton's historic leather-tanning heritage has given way to a charming residential community where older homes and new construction create diverse heating opportunities. Halton Hills Hydro serves Acton with reliable electrical infrastructure supporting heat pump installations. Located on the Niagara Escarpment, Acton experiences slightly cooler winters than lakeshore communities, with temperatures regularly reaching -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C handle these conditions reliably. Historic downtown Acton along Mill Street features character homes where ductless mini-splits preserve architectural integrity while delivering modern efficiency. Newer residential areas north and east of the village core suit ducted systems well. Acton's location allows access to natural gas, but heat pump savings of 35-45% on heating costs make conversion attractive, especially with up to $7,100 available through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The community's blend of heritage appreciation and modern living makes heat pump technology an excellent fit.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our Victorian home in downtown Acton needed careful handling for any HVAC upgrade. B.A.P installed a ductless heat pump system that provides excellent heating and cooling without any impact to our heritage features. The energy savings have been impressive, and the rebates helped offset the cost significantly."
