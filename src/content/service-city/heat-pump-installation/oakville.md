localContext: |
  Oakville's discerning homeowners increasingly recognize heat pumps as the premium choice for home comfort and environmental responsibility. Oakville Hydro provides excellent electrical infrastructure supporting the growing demand for electrified heating solutions. Lake Ontario moderates temperatures along the shoreline in Old Oakville and Bronte, while north Oakville communities experience slightly colder winters—our cold-climate heat pumps perform reliably to -25°C across all conditions. Heritage homes in downtown Oakville and Kerr Village benefit from ductless installations that preserve architectural character. Executive homes in Glen Abbey, River Oaks, and Joshua Creek are ideal for high-capacity ducted systems with zoning capabilities. Oakville homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant, making heat pump installation highly cost-effective. With larger homes common in Oakville, properly-sized heat pump systems typically deliver 35-50% savings on heating costs while providing superior comfort and eliminating the carbon footprint of natural gas heating.
