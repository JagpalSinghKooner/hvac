localContext: |
  Breslau's rapid growth as a residential community between Kitchener and Guelph has brought modern homes ideally suited for heat pump technology. Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro serves Breslau with robust electrical infrastructure designed to support the area's expanding residential base. Located along the Grand River, Breslau experiences typical Waterloo Region winters with temperatures reaching -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps rated to -25°C ensure reliable heating throughout the season. The established village core features older homes where ductless systems offer flexible retrofit options. Breslau's extensive new construction—including developments near the Breslau Community Centre and along Victoria Street—presents ideal opportunities for ducted heat pump systems, often replacing builder-grade equipment with superior efficiency. Breslau homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. Young families moving to Breslau appreciate heat pump benefits: combined heating and cooling, lower operating costs (typically 35-45% savings), and modern smart thermostat integration.

  testimonial: "When we built our new home in Breslau, we upgraded to a heat pump instead of the standard furnace and AC. B.A.P helped us understand the rebates and long-term savings. Our first year's energy costs were much lower than our neighbors with conventional systems."
