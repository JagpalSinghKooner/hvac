localContext: |
  Waterloo's university-influenced culture has created strong demand for energy-efficient, environmentally responsible heating solutions. Waterloo North Hydro provides excellent electrical infrastructure throughout the city, supporting the growing number of heat pump installations. The city's climate mirrors the broader Region of Waterloo, with winter lows frequently reaching -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps operate efficiently down to -25°C and beyond. Historic homes in Uptown Waterloo and the Mary-Allen neighborhood benefit from ductless installations that avoid disrupting original features. Family-oriented areas like Lakeshore, Beechwood, and Laurelwood see excellent results with central ducted systems integrated into existing HVAC. Waterloo homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant, significantly reducing installation costs. The tech-savvy population appreciates smart thermostat integration and the dual heating/cooling capability that eliminates the need for separate systems. Typical savings range from 35-50% compared to gas heating.

  testimonial: "As engineers, we researched heat pumps thoroughly before choosing B.A.P. They installed a cold-climate system in our Beechwood home that performs exactly as promised—even during the polar vortex last winter. The rebates and energy savings made this an easy financial decision."
