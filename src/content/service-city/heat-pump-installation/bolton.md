localContext: |
  Bolton, as Caledon's largest urban center, offers a mix of established neighborhoods and new developments well-suited for heat pump technology. Hydro One provides electrical service throughout Bolton with infrastructure supporting residential heat pump installations. Located on the edge of the Oak Ridges Moraine, Bolton experiences typical Southern Ontario winters with temperatures reaching -15°C to -20°C—our cold-climate heat pumps operate efficiently to -25°C and below. Historic downtown Bolton features older homes where ductless mini-splits offer retrofit flexibility without major renovations. Newer subdivisions north and south of King Street are excellent candidates for ducted heat pump systems, often replacing builder-grade furnaces with superior efficiency. Bolton homeowners can access up to $7,100 through the Canada Greener Homes Grant. The growing community appreciates heat pump benefits: combined heating and cooling from one system, lower operating costs (typically 35-45% savings), and reduced environmental impact compared to natural gas heating.
localProof:
  testimonial: "We upgraded from our builder furnace to a heat pump when it was time for replacement. B.A.P handled everything including the rebate paperwork. Our Bolton home is more comfortable than ever—better heating in winter and air conditioning we did not have before."
