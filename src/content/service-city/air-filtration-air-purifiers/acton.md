localContext: |
  Acton's small-town character and historic downtown attract residents seeking community-oriented living, but the area's geography and housing stock create specific indoor air quality challenges. The town's industrial heritage from the leather tanning industry has evolved, but older homes in established neighbourhoods may have accumulated decades of dust and particles in aging ductwork systems. Acton's location near the Niagara Escarpment and surrounding conservation lands contributes to elevated pollen and mould spore counts during warmer months, affecting allergy sufferers throughout the community. The Fairy Lake area and Black Creek corridor create humidity conditions that can promote mould growth in basements. Many Acton families own pets, with dogs especially popular in this walkable community, creating ongoing challenges with pet dander accumulation. The town's mix of heritage homes and newer developments means varied air quality challenges requiring customized filtration solutions.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our older home near Fairy Lake always had humidity issues and musty smells in the basement. The air purifier combined with our dehumidifier finally solved the problem. The whole house smells fresh now."
