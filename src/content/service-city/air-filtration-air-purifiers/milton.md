localContext: |
  Milton has experienced explosive growth over the past two decades, bringing specific indoor air quality considerations for both new and established homeowners. The town's numerous new construction developments in areas like Willmott, Harrison, and Scott feature modern, energy-efficient homes with tight building envelopes that can trap VOCs from new building materials, carpets, and furnishings. These off-gassing chemicals need proper filtration to maintain healthy indoor air. Milton's proximity to the Niagara Escarpment means abundant natural areas and agricultural land, contributing to seasonal pollen and dust that infiltrate homes throughout the community. Young families dominate Milton's demographics, with many households featuring both children and pets requiring clean air solutions. The town's rapid development also means construction dust can be an ongoing concern in actively building neighbourhoods. Milton families increasingly prioritize health-conscious home improvements as they settle into their growing community.
