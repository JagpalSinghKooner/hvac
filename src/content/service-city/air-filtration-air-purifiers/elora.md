localContext: |
  Elora's reputation as one of Ontario's most beautiful villages attracts residents who appreciate natural beauty and quality living, extending that appreciation to their indoor environments. The village's location along the Grand River and famous Elora Gorge creates elevated humidity levels that can promote mould growth in the charming historic homes that define the community. Elora's heritage buildings and century homes feature older construction where dust, mould spores, and allergens have accumulated in aging systems over many decades. The surrounding conservation areas and abundant vegetation contribute to elevated pollen counts during spring and summer, affecting allergy sufferers throughout the village. Many Elora residents are artists, craftspeople, and professionals who work from home, making indoor air quality essential for daily productivity and comfort. The village's tourism and hospitality businesses also benefit from superior indoor air quality for guests and customers.
