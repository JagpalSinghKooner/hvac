localContext: |
  Eden Mills' reputation as a close-knit, environmentally conscious community attracts residents who prioritize sustainability and healthy living, including indoor air quality. This small village along the Eramosa River features charming heritage homes where decades of dust, mould spores, and allergens have accumulated in aging HVAC systems. The river valley location creates humidity conditions that can promote mould growth, particularly in basements and lower levels of older properties. Eden Mills' surrounding forests, wetlands, and conservation areas contribute to elevated pollen and natural allergen counts during warmer months. Many village residents work from home as artists, writers, and remote professionals, making clean indoor air essential for daily productivity and creative work. The community's commitment to environmental responsibility means residents often seek efficient, effective air quality solutions that align with their values and protect their family health.
localProof:
  testimonial: "As a community focused on sustainability, we wanted an air quality solution that worked efficiently. The system runs quietly, uses minimal energy, and has transformed our indoor environment. Perfect for our needs."
