localContext: |
  Shelburne's position at the edge of the Greater Toronto Area offers residents small-town living with unique indoor air quality considerations. The town's location near the Niagara Escarpment and surrounded by Dufferin County farmland means seasonal exposure to agricultural dust, crop pollen, and farming-related particles that infiltrate homes throughout the community. Shelburne's rapid growth has brought new construction developments where off-gassing from building materials, carpets, and new furnishings releases volatile organic compounds into tightly sealed modern homes. The town's older established neighbourhoods feature homes where decades of dust and allergens have accumulated in aging ductwork. Many Shelburne families own dogs, cats, and other pets, with animal dander becoming a persistent indoor air quality challenge. The surrounding forests and natural areas contribute to elevated pollen counts during allergy season, affecting residents who moved to Shelburne seeking cleaner country air.

  testimonial: "We thought country air would help our son asthma, but the pollen and dust were actually triggering more attacks. The air purifier made our home the safe haven we hoped for when we moved here."
