  headline: 'Indoor Air Quality Challenges in Historic Village Homes'
  description: 'St. Jacobs homeowners face air quality challenges that go beyond typical HVAC concerns. Century-old buildings with original plaster and minimal natural ventilation trap cooking odors, humidity, and airborne particles. Tighter windows added for energy efficiency create stagnant air. The village location near agricultural lands means seasonal pollen and dust. Historic homes lack the mechanical ventilation modern building codes require. Occupants notice persistent stuffiness, allergy symptoms that worsen indoors, and lingering smells. These issues intensify in winter when homes stay sealed. Air quality matters more when the building itself limits natural ventilation options.'
  issues:
    - 'Poor air circulation in heritage buildings with sealed windows'
    - 'Allergen accumulation from nearby agricultural activity'
    - 'Indoor air feels stale despite regular cleaning efforts'
solution:
  headline: 'Thoughtful Air Filtration for Heritage Architecture'
  description: 'Effective air filtration for St. Jacobs homes requires systems that integrate with existing HVAC without invasive modifications. We install whole-home air purifiers that connect to your current ductwork, processing air every time the furnace or AC runs. HEPA filtration removes 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.3 microns, capturing pollen, dust, pet dander, and mold spores. UV-C systems add pathogen neutralization without chemicals or filters to replace. For homes without central ductwork, standalone HEPA units provide room-specific air cleaning. Installation respects original finishes by working within mechanical spaces. Systems integrate with existing thermostats for seamless operation. Proper sizing ensures adequate air changes per hour without straining your HVAC equipment.'

context: |
  St. Jacobs'' position in Woolwich Township brings unique indoor air quality considerations. The village''s proximity to surrounding agricultural operations means higher seasonal pollen counts and airborne dust from field work. Heritage architecture prioritized solid construction over mechanical ventilation, creating homes that trap indoor air. Original windows sealed for energy efficiency eliminate natural air exchange. Century-old plaster walls absorb and release moisture, sometimes contributing to musty odors. The Main Street tourist area means higher foot traffic and outdoor pollutants entering homes. Modern occupancy patterns keep buildings closed year-round unlike original seasonal use. These factors combine to make mechanical air filtration essential for comfortable indoor environments.

  Waterloo North Hydro Electric serves St. Jacobs, connecting residents to Save on Energy programs. The village's historic district designation means installation approaches must respect appearance standards. HVAC work in century-old buildings requires understanding of load-bearing structures and original construction methods. Local building characteristics include hand-hewn timber frames, horsehair plaster, and minimal mechanical chases. Air quality improvements must work within these constraints without visible exterior modifications.
