localContext: |
  Brantford homeowners face indoor air quality challenges shaped by the city's industrial history and geographic location. The Grand River valley creates humidity conditions that can promote mould growth in basements and older homes throughout the city. Brantford's historic neighbourhoods, including the beautiful homes in West Brant and Eagle Place, feature older construction where dust and allergens accumulate in aging ductwork systems over decades. The city's manufacturing sector, while providing employment, means some areas experience industrial particulates that benefit from whole-home filtration. Brantford's affordable housing has attracted many young families with children and pets, creating demand for air quality solutions that address dander, dust, and allergens. Agricultural activity surrounding the city contributes seasonal pollen and dust, particularly during spring planting and fall harvest. Many Brantford residents appreciate practical, effective solutions that improve their family's health without breaking the budget.
