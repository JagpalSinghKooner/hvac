localContext: |
  Georgetown's position as Halton Hills' largest community offers residents small-town charm with convenient GTA access, bringing specific indoor air quality considerations. The town's historic downtown and established neighbourhoods feature older homes where decades of dust, mould spores, and allergens have accumulated in aging HVAC systems. Georgetown's location near the Niagara Escarpment and Credit River headwaters means abundant forests and green spaces that unfortunately contribute to elevated pollen counts during allergy season. The town's mix of heritage homes and modern developments in areas like the Cedarvale neighbourhood means varied air quality challenges, from aging ductwork in older properties to off-gassing VOCs in new construction. Many Georgetown families have multiple pets, with dogs especially popular given the community's excellent walking trails. Agricultural activity in surrounding areas contributes seasonal dust and crop-related particles.
localProof:
  testimonial: "With three kids and two dogs, our Georgetown home needed serious air quality help. The whole-home purifier handles everything. No more pet odours, no more allergy complaints. Our home finally feels truly clean."
