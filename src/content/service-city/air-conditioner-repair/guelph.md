problem:
  headline: Cooling Failures During Guelph Heat Waves
  description: Air conditioner breakdowns peak during Guelph's first heat wave of the season (typically late May or early June) when units that sat dormant for 8 months are suddenly asked to run continuously. Capacitor failures, refrigerant leaks, and contactor issues that developed during winter dormancy only become apparent when outdoor temperatures hit 28 to 30 degrees Celsius and humidity climbs above 60%. Service calls during heat waves stretch to 3 to 5 day waits, leaving homes uncomfortable when cooling matters most.
  issues:
    - Capacitors that start motors and compressors degrade from temperature cycling and typically fail in years 7 to 10, causing air conditioners to hum without starting or trip breakers repeatedly, and failures always occur during peak cooling demand
    - Refrigerant leaks from vibration-worn fittings or corroded evaporator coils reduce cooling capacity gradually, showing up as air conditioners that run constantly but never reach thermostat setpoint, and refrigerant top-ups without finding and fixing leaks waste money and harm the environment
    - Contactor wear from thousands of on-off cycles causes intermittent operation where air conditioners work for a few hours then shut down randomly, and burned contacts create voltage drops that damage compressors if not replaced promptly
    - Air conditioners over 12 years old using R-22 refrigerant face repair cost premiums because R-22 is phased out and expensive, and charging $500 to $800 to refill refrigerant on a 15-year-old unit rarely makes sense compared to replacement with modern R-410A systems
context: |
  Guelph's humid continental climate brings intense summer heat waves that push air conditioning systems to their limits, particularly during July and August when temperatures regularly climb into the high 30s with humidity. The Old University area and downtown core feature many heritage homes from the 1800s that have been retrofitted with central air systems, often requiring specialized repair knowledge for older ductwork configurations. Newer subdivisions in the south end near the Hanlon Expressway and developments around Guelph Lake have modern high-efficiency units that demand technicians certified in current refrigerant standards. The Westminster Woods and Kortright Hills neighbourhoods see high demand for emergency AC repairs during heat waves, especially from families with young children and seniors who cannot safely endure extended periods without cooling. Common issues we address include compressor failures from overworked systems, refrigerant leaks in aging equipment, and frozen evaporator coils caused by restricted airflow in dusty older homes.
proof:
  testimonial: "Our AC died during the hottest week of July. B.A.P had a technician at our door within three hours and diagnosed a failed capacitor. He had the part on his truck and we had cold air before dinner. Absolutely lifesaving service."
