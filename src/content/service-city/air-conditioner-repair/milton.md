localContext: |
  Milton has experienced explosive growth over the past two decades, creating a community where most homes are relatively new but AC systems still face intense summer demands. The Escarpment-side neighbourhoods like Willmott, Dorset Park, and Beaty experience summer heat that radiates off the rock face, pushing cooling systems harder than typical suburban installations. The older downtown core and established areas near Martin Street feature homes from earlier eras with retrofitted AC that requires different repair approaches than modern subdivisions. Bristol and Coates developments contain homes built in the 2000s and 2010s where builder-grade AC units are now showing their age with capacitor failures and refrigerant issues. Milton's young families rely heavily on air conditioning for sleeping children and home offices, making emergency repair response critical. The town's location along the 401 corridor means summer traffic congestion can trap heat in neighbourhoods, adding to cooling demands. Our Milton technicians handle everything from warranty-era repairs on newer systems to comprehensive diagnostics on aging equipment.
localProof:
  testimonial: "With three kids under seven, AC is not optional in our Milton home. When ours failed during a heat warning, B.A.P had a technician at our Willmott house within three hours. Turned out to be a faulty thermostat wire—fixed in under an hour. So grateful for the fast response."
