localContext: |
  Cambridge experiences some of the region's most demanding summer conditions, with the Grand River valley trapping heat and humidity that makes reliable air conditioning essential for comfort and safety. The city's three distinct cores—Galt, Preston, and Hespeler—each present unique AC repair challenges. Historic Galt features Victorian-era homes along the river that often have retrofitted cooling systems requiring careful integration with older electrical panels and ductwork. Preston's mix of post-war bungalows commonly have aging central air units from the 1990s now reaching end-of-life, while Hespeler's newer developments feature modern high-SEER systems. The Blair and Riverside Park areas see frequent emergency calls during heat waves, particularly from residents in older townhouse complexes where shared walls can amplify heat buildup. Our Cambridge technicians regularly address compressor burnouts, refrigerant issues with R-22 systems requiring conversion, and thermostat malfunctions in homes with outdated wiring.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Living in an older Galt home means our AC works overtime in summer. When it stopped blowing cold air on a 35-degree day, B.A.P came out within two hours. The technician found a refrigerant leak, fixed it properly, and recharged the system. Outstanding emergency service."
