  headline: 'Cold Homes When Furnaces Stop Working Properly'
  description: |
    New Hamburg families face furnace failures that range from complete breakdowns to partial malfunctions that leave some rooms cold while others overheat. Ignition failures prevent furnaces from starting, leaving families scrambling for space heaters while waiting for service. Blower motor problems stop air circulation even though burners fire, creating hot equipment and cold rooms—a safety concern beyond just discomfort. Cracked heat exchangers pose carbon monoxide risks that demand immediate shutdown until repaired or replaced.

    Thermostat communication failures cause erratic heating cycles that waste energy while failing to maintain comfortable temperatures. Limit switches trip repeatedly, shutting down furnaces before rooms reach set temperature. Dirty flame sensors prevent proper burner operation, creating intermittent heat that makes planning around repair needs difficult for working families. Gas valve malfunctions create partial heating where some burners fire while others remain cold, reducing capacity just when January temperatures demand full output.

    Many families delay calling for service, hoping problems resolve themselves or trying to limp through another day, which often transforms simple repairs into more expensive failures as secondary components get damaged by continued operation of compromised systems.
  issues:
    - 'Complete furnace failures leaving families without heat during winter weather'
    - 'Intermittent problems making it difficult to schedule repairs around work and family'
    - 'Uncertainty about repair costs versus replacement decisions for aging equipment'

solution:
  headline: 'Reliable Furnace Repairs From Experienced Technicians'
  description: |
    Our diagnostic process begins with symptom description from homeowners—when the problem occurs, what sounds or behaviors you have noticed, and how long issues have persisted. This information helps technicians arrive prepared with likely replacement parts, reducing service time and callbacks. We test all furnace systems methodically, isolating the actual failure rather than replacing parts that are functioning normally. Gas pressure testing, combustion analysis, and electrical measurements identify root causes, not just symptoms.

    Common repairs include igniter replacement for systems that will not start, flame sensor cleaning for intermittent operation, and blower motor service or replacement for airflow problems. We test limit switches and safeties, ensuring furnaces shut down properly when conditions warrant rather than continuing operation unsafely. For heat exchanger cracks, we provide honest assessment about whether repair makes sense given equipment age and condition, or whether replacement is the more prudent choice for long-term reliability.

    All repairs are completed to TSSA standards with proper gas testing afterward to ensure safe operation. We explain what failed, why it likely happened, and what homeowners can do to prevent recurrence. Pricing is upfront before work begins, and we discuss whether repair extends equipment life meaningfully or whether replacement should be considered given age and overall condition.

contextHeadline: 'Furnace Repair Services Throughout Wilmot Township'
context: |
  New Hamburg''s housing mix creates diverse furnace repair needs. Newer developments feature modern high-efficiency equipment where electronic controls and variable-speed components require specific diagnostic expertise. Older neighborhoods have furnaces from the 1990s and 2000s where mechanical failures and wear are common, but parts availability and repair costs must be weighed against replacement benefits. Home offices have become standard in commuter communities, making daytime heating reliability essential for productivity, not just comfort.

  Winter temperatures in Wilmot Township regularly drop to -20°C, creating high demand for heating capacity and making furnace failures more than inconveniences—they are urgent problems affecting daily life. Quick response and accurate repair become essential when children are home from school or remote workers cannot function in cold offices. Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro provides electricity, and Enbridge Gas supplies natural gas across New Hamburg, giving families the utility infrastructure that modern heating systems depend upon.

  With 32 years and over 1,250 repairs serving New Hamburg families, we understand the stress heating failures create. Our response times, diagnostic accuracy, and honest repair-versus-replacement guidance help families make decisions that serve long-term interests rather than just solving immediate problems.

  headline: 'Smart Repair Choices for Your Heating System'
  description: |
    Furnace repairs typically cost $250-$800 depending on which components failed, compared to $12,000-$15,000 for complete replacement. For equipment under 12 years old, most repairs make economic sense and restore years of reliable service. For furnaces approaching 15-18 years, repair costs must be weighed against remaining lifespan and efficiency improvements available from replacement.

    Our guidance considers total cost of ownership—a $600 repair on a 16-year-old furnace may restore heat now but require additional repairs within 2-3 years, while replacement delivers 20 years of reliable service plus 30% efficiency improvement. Conversely, the same $600 repair on an 8-year-old furnace restores a system that should operate reliably for another decade, making it the clear financial choice. We provide this context so families make informed decisions aligned with their situations and budgets.
  rebateInfo: 'If repair costs approach replacement economics, Save on Energy provides up to $2,500 for high-efficiency furnace installation through Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro, improving the financial case for replacement.'

proof:
  testimonial: 'Our furnace stopped working completely on a Tuesday morning in January—house temperature dropped to 12°C before we called. B.A.P had a technician here within three hours who diagnosed a failed inducer motor. The repair was $485, and heat was restored before the kids came home from school. The technician explained that our 9-year-old furnace should give us another decade of service with this fix, so we knew repair made sense rather than replacing it.'
