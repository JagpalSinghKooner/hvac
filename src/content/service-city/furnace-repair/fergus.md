  headline: 'Common Furnace Failures in Centre Wellington Homes'
  description: |
    Furnace failures follow predictable patterns in Fergus homes—ignition problems when cold weather arrives, blower issues mid-season, and heat exchanger stress near winter's end. Heritage properties downtown often experience control problems from retrofitted thermostats incompatible with modern furnace electronics. Riverside homes face condensate freeze issues when drain lines aren't properly routed. Newer homes in developments like Fergusson West sometimes have improperly sized ductwork causing premature blower motor failure. The repair decision homeowners face isn't whether to fix the equipment—it's whether the diagnosis is accurate and the repair will last. Misdiagnosed problems lead to repeat failures and wasted money. Parts-replacement approaches that ignore underlying causes create temporary fixes requiring additional service calls. When temperatures drop to -20°C and your furnace stops, you need accurate diagnosis, not guesswork with expensive components.
  issues:
    - 'Inaccurate diagnosis wastes money replacing parts that aren''t causing the failure'
    - 'Quick fixes ignore underlying problems, leading to repeat breakdowns weeks later'
    - 'Emergency repairs during peak demand often cost 50-100% more than off-season service'

  headline: 'Diagnostic Furnace Repair for Fergus Properties'
  description: |
    B.A.P repair service starts with accurate diagnosis using combustion analysis and electrical testing that identifies root causes, not just symptoms. Techs understand how Centre Wellington's temperature swings stress components differently than steady cold. Experience with both heritage properties and modern construction means understanding which problems stem from equipment age versus installation issues. Repair recommendations include honest assessment of remaining equipment life—sometimes the most valuable repair advice is explaining when replacement makes better economic sense. When repairs are appropriate, work follows manufacturer specifications using quality components that match original equipment standards. Documentation includes photographs and technical data supporting repair recommendations—transparency that helps homeowners make informed decisions. Follow-up includes verifying the repair solved the problem, not just temporarily addressing symptoms. The difference between competent repair and parts replacement becomes obvious when winter returns—quality repairs last, quick fixes fail.

  Since 1994, B.A.P has been repairing furnaces across Fergus's diverse properties, from downtown stone buildings to subdivisions near the Grand River. Three decades and over 1,050 repairs create pattern recognition—we know which failures indicate simple fixes versus pending equipment failure, how building characteristics affect repair longevity, and when honest advice means recommending replacement instead of expensive temporary repairs. When a furnace fails mid-winter and you are evaluating $500-$1,500 repair costs versus replacement, institutional knowledge matters.

contextHeadline: 'How Fergus Housing Stock Affects Furnace Reliability'
context: |
  Fergus's architectural diversity creates varied furnace repair scenarios. Downtown heritage properties often feature beautiful stone construction with modern furnaces installed in tight mechanical spaces, making some repairs more complex than suburban work. Riverside homes face humidity affecting electrical components and control boards. Established neighbourhoods between downtown and newer areas contain homes from 1970s-1990s with furnaces approaching end-of-life, where repair economics require careful evaluation. Modern subdivisions near the Sportsplex feature high-efficiency condensing furnaces with different failure patterns than conventional equipment—drain problems, inducer motor issues, and control board sensitivities.

  Centre Wellington Hydro provides electricity making electronic controls and variable-speed blowers standard on newer Fergus furnaces—adding efficiency but also complexity when failures occur. With 32 years and over 1,050 repairs across Fergus, we understand how local housing characteristics affect failure patterns and repair requirements.

  headline: 'Repair vs Replace Decisions for Fergus Homeowners'
  description: |
    Furnace repairs typically cost $300-$1,500 depending on components and complexity. Equipment under 12 years old usually justifies repair costs; systems over 18 years require careful economics. The general rule suggests repair when costs are less than one-third of replacement expense—but that oversimplifies decisions requiring judgment about remaining equipment life, efficiency improvements with new equipment, and rebate availability. Sometimes a $900 repair on a 16-year-old furnace makes perfect sense; other times a $400 fix on a 14-year-old unit is poor value if efficiency losses and pending failures are obvious. Honest assessment considers total costs over the next 5 years, not just immediate repair expense.
  rebateInfo: 'Enbridge Gas provides rebates up to $1,750 for high-efficiency furnace replacement when older equipment fails, available to Fergus homeowners served by Enbridge distribution.'

proof:
  testimonial: 'Our furnace quit on a Saturday morning in January. B.A.P came out, diagnosed a failed inducer motor, and explained our options clearly—repair for $680 or replacement with rebates. The furnace was only 11 years old, so repair made sense. Three years later it is still running perfectly. Their honesty saved us thousands.'
