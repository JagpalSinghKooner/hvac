problem:
  headline: When to Repair vs. Replace Your Aging Furnace
  description: Furnace repairs in Guelph become a judgment call around year 12 to 15. A $400 to $800 repair on a 10-year-old furnace makes sense. The same repair on a 17-year-old furnace with 80% AFUE is harder to justify when new units deliver 96% efficiency and pay for themselves in fuel savings over 7 to 10 years. The challenge is diagnosing whether you are fixing a single failing part or postponing inevitable replacement by one more winter.
  issues:
    - Intermittent ignition failures during Guelph's coldest weeks (typically late January through early February) indicate failing hot surface igniters or cracked heat exchangers, but symptoms only appear when outdoor temperatures drop below minus 15 degrees Celsius
    - Blower motors that cycle on and off randomly or run continuously after the heating cycle ends signal failing control boards or capacitors, common in furnaces over 12 years old and often leading to secondary failures if not addressed
    - Yellow or flickering burner flames instead of steady blue indicate incomplete combustion from dirty burners, restricted airflow, or cracked heat exchangers, all of which reduce efficiency and pose carbon monoxide risks in older homes with minimal fresh air intake
    - Repair costs over $500 on furnaces older than 15 years rarely make financial sense when factoring in efficiency losses, especially for homeowners planning to stay in Guelph properties long-term
context: |
  Guelph's diverse housing stock presents unique furnace repair challenges that our technicians handle daily. The historic stone homes in the Ward and Downtown area often have older heating systems that require specialized diagnostic expertise, while newer developments in the South End and Kortright Hills feature high-efficiency units that demand modern troubleshooting skills. Guelph experiences significant temperature swings during winter months, with the Speed River valley creating localized cold pockets that push furnaces harder than surrounding areas. Common repair calls in Guelph include igniter failures in older homes near the University of Guelph campus, blower motor issues in St. Patrick's Ward properties, and heat exchanger problems in Exhibition Park area residences. Our emergency response teams are strategically positioned to reach any Guelph neighbourhood within 45 minutes, ensuring rapid service when your furnace fails during a cold snap.

  testimonial: "Our furnace stopped working at 11 PM on the coldest night of January. B.A.P had a technician at our door within an hour. He diagnosed a failed igniter, had the part on his truck, and we had heat again before midnight. Incredible service."
