localContext: |
  Erin's small-town character and rural setting create specific AC maintenance considerations for homeowners. Located in the hills of Wellington County, the town experiences warm summer months with temperatures that make reliable air conditioning important for comfort. The village centre features charming older homes where central air has been retrofitted, requiring careful attention to ductwork and system balance. Surrounding rural properties often have larger homes with high-capacity cooling systems serving substantial square footage. Many AC units in Erin date from the late 1990s and early 2000s when central air became more common in the area, meaning these systems are now reaching the age where regular maintenance is critical to continued reliability. The agricultural surroundings mean outdoor units are exposed to hay dust, pollen, and seed debris throughout the growing season. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance in early April, before spring fieldwork begins stirring up dust. Common findings include heavily clogged condenser coils and well water mineral deposits affecting system components.
