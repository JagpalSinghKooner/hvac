localContext: |
  Jerseyville is a small rural community in the Township of Ancaster, nestled in the beautiful countryside between Hamilton and Brantford. The hamlet and surrounding area feature a mix of historic farmhouses, rural estates, and newer country properties where reliable air conditioning provides essential comfort during humid summer months. Many homes in the Jerseyville area are larger properties with high-capacity cooling systems serving substantial square footage, where efficiency losses from poor maintenance translate to significant energy costs. The agricultural setting means outdoor units are constantly exposed to crop dust, hay particles, and pollen throughout the growing season, with harvest time bringing particularly heavy debris loads. Summer temperatures in the area regularly reach the high 20s and low 30s with humidity that makes cooling essential. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance by early April, before spring planting activities increase airborne particulates. Common findings include severely clogged condenser coils from farm dust, well water mineral deposits, and oversized systems in older farmhouses with inadequate insulation.
