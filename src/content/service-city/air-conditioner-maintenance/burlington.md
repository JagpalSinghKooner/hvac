seoDescription: 'Professional AC maintenance in Burlington, ON. Spring tune-ups for reliable summer cooling. Serving Burlington since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Burlington enjoys a moderate lakeside climate, though summer months still bring stretches of humid, warm weather that demand reliable air conditioning. The city's diverse housing stock ranges from mid-century homes in Aldershot and downtown Burlington to newer builds in Millcroft and Orchard. Lakefront properties in Roseland and along Lakeshore Road experience different cooling patterns than homes on the escarpment in Tyandaga, where elevation affects summer temperatures. Many Burlington AC systems date from the 1990s renovation wave when central air became standard in older homes, making these units prime candidates for annual maintenance as they approach or exceed 20 years of service. We recommend scheduling maintenance in early spring before the Sound of Music Festival crowds and summer activities begin. Common findings include salt corrosion on units near the QEW, cottonwood seed accumulation, and hard water scale buildup on evaporator coils from Burlington's mineral-rich water supply.
