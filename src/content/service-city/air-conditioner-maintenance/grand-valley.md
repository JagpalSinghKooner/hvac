localContext: |
  Grand Valley is a small, tight-knit community in Dufferin County where many residents have lived for generations and newer families are discovering the appeal of rural small-town life. Summer months bring warm temperatures that make air conditioning increasingly important, particularly during July and August heat waves. The village core features a mix of historic homes along Main Street where AC systems have been retrofitted, and newer construction in surrounding subdivisions with modern equipment. Many homes in Grand Valley have AC units installed in the late 1990s and 2000s that are now approaching or exceeding 20 years of service and require diligent maintenance. The agricultural setting means outdoor units are constantly exposed to crop dust, pollen, and debris from surrounding farmland throughout the growing season. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance in early April, before spring planting stirs up dust. Common findings include severely clogged condenser coils, well water mineral deposits on evaporator components, and aging capacitors in older systems.
