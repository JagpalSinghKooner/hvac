localContext: |
  Hamilton's position at the western end of Lake Ontario creates unique summer weather patterns, with lake breezes moderating temperatures on the Mountain while the lower city can experience intense heat and humidity. Neighbourhoods like Westdale and Dundas benefit from escarpment airflow, while areas such as Stoney Creek and Binbrook see higher cooling demands. Many Hamilton homes feature AC systems installed during the housing expansion of the 1990s and early 2000s, with Mountain-area developments from that era now requiring close attention to aging components. The industrial heritage of the city means some areas experience higher particulate levels that can affect condenser coil performance. We recommend scheduling spring maintenance by late March, as Hamilton's proximity to the lake often brings earlier warm spells. Common findings include salt damage on units near major roadways and mineral buildup from Hamilton's hard water supply affecting drain lines and evaporator coils.
