localContext: |
  Oakville's lakeside position brings humid summer conditions that make reliable air conditioning essential for comfort. From the heritage homes of downtown Oakville and Bronte to the executive properties in Glen Abbey and River Oaks, homeowners depend on well-maintained cooling systems throughout the warm months. Many prestigious homes in Joshua Creek and Iroquois Ridge feature high-capacity AC systems that require specialized maintenance attention to operate at peak efficiency. Properties near Lake Ontario experience salt air that can accelerate condenser corrosion, while inland areas deal with pollen and seed accumulation from mature landscaping. We recommend scheduling spring tune-ups by early April, before the golf season begins and homeowners turn their attention to outdoor activities. Common maintenance findings in Oakville include oversized systems that short-cycle due to improper original sizing, and premium equipment that benefits from manufacturer-specific service protocols.
