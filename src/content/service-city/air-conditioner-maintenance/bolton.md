seoDescription: 'Professional AC maintenance in Bolton, ON. Spring tune-ups for reliable summer cooling. Serving Bolton since 1992.'
localContext: |
  Bolton has experienced significant residential growth in recent years, with many new homes featuring modern high-efficiency AC systems that still require annual maintenance for optimal performance. The village's position along the Humber River valley brings humid summer conditions typical of the region, with temperatures regularly climbing into the high 20s and low 30s from June through August. Established neighbourhoods near downtown Bolton and along King Street have older housing stock with AC systems often dating from the early 2000s, while newer subdivisions in the north end feature equipment installed within the past decade. The mix of agricultural land surrounding Bolton means outdoor units are frequently exposed to crop dust, pollen, and debris during growing season. We recommend scheduling spring tune-ups by mid-April, before the spring planting season increases airborne particulates. Common findings include dirty condenser coils from rural dust and drain line issues from the area's hard water supply.
