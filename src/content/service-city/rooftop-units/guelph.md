localContext: |
  Guelph's thriving commercial sector features extensive RTU installations across its diverse business landscape. The Hanlon Creek Business Park and surrounding industrial corridors house manufacturing facilities and distribution centres that rely heavily on rooftop HVAC systems for year-round climate control. Downtown Guelph's heritage buildings and modern retail plazas along Stone Road present unique RTU challenges, from retrofit installations on older structures to multi-unit systems on big-box retailers. The University of Guelph research park and surrounding tech companies require precise temperature and humidity control for laboratories and server rooms, making reliable RTU service essential for their operations.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our distribution centre runs 24/7 and we cannot afford HVAC downtime. B.A.P replaced three aging RTUs over a weekend without disrupting our operations. Their crane coordination and after-hours work saved us significant revenue."
