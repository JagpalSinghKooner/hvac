The Highway 7 corridor through town features local retail, automotive services, and commercial enterprises utilizing rooftop HVAC systems. The Rockwood industrial area houses manufacturing facilities and distribution operations serving the Greater Golden Horseshoe. The village's heritage downtown presents retrofit opportunities for historic stone buildings housing restaurants, shops, and professional offices.
