localContext: |
  Milton's explosive growth has created a booming commercial sector with extensive RTU installation demands. The 401 and 407 corridor developments feature massive distribution centres and logistics hubs operated by major national retailers and e-commerce companies, all requiring high-capacity rooftop units for their sprawling facilities. The Milton Crossroads retail development and surrounding commercial areas utilize multi-unit RTU systems for their tenant mix. The Derry Road business corridor houses professional offices and light industrial facilities, while the historic downtown area presents retrofit opportunities for commercial heritage buildings. Milton's status as one of Canada's fastest-growing communities means constant new construction and RTU installation opportunities.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our 500,000 square foot distribution centre required 12 RTU installations coordinated with our construction timeline. B.A.P managed the entire project, from crane logistics to commissioning. They delivered on time and on budget."
