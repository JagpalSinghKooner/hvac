localContext: |
  Shelburne serves as a commercial hub for northern Dufferin County with growing RTU service demands across its business community. The Highway 10 corridor features retail plazas, grocery stores, and service businesses with rooftop HVAC systems serving the expanding residential population. The industrial areas along the highway house manufacturing and distribution facilities requiring reliable climate control. Downtown Shelburne's Main Street presents retrofit opportunities for heritage commercial buildings, while the surrounding agricultural community relies on local equipment dealers and processing facilities with industrial-grade HVAC needs. Shelburne's position as a gateway to the Headwaters region makes dependable commercial climate control essential for businesses serving tourists and local residents alike.
