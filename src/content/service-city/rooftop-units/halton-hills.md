localContext: |
  Halton Hills' commercial sector spans the communities of Georgetown and Acton, each with distinct RTU service requirements. Georgetown's growing business parks along the 401 corridor feature modern commercial and light industrial facilities with new RTU installations, while the historic downtown core presents retrofit opportunities for heritage commercial buildings. The Georgetown Marketplace and surrounding retail developments utilize multi-unit rooftop systems. Acton's traditional manufacturing sector requires industrial-grade RTUs for production facilities, and the tannery heritage has given way to modern commercial developments. The rural character of the surrounding area includes agricultural processing facilities and country commercial properties with unique HVAC challenges.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our heritage building in downtown Georgetown needed modern climate control without compromising the historic structure. B.A.P designed a rooftop solution that met heritage requirements while providing efficient heating and cooling. Creative problem solving."
