seoDescription: 'Expert heat pump repair in Guelph, ON. All brands serviced, same-day appointments. Serving Guelph since 1992.'
trustOpener: 'Three decades of heat pump service in Guelph has taught B.A.P the specific failure patterns that occur when these systems operate in cold climates. Not all heat pumps are rated for Ontario winters, and we can diagnose whether performance issues are fixable or indicate a system that was undersized or improperly installed. Honest diagnosis means we tell you when repair costs don''t make sense given the system''s remaining lifespan.'
problem:
  headline: Cold-Climate Heat Pump Failures During Peak Demand
  description: Heat pumps work harder than furnaces or air conditioners because they run year-round, and cold-climate models face extreme stress during Guelph's coldest weeks when outdoor coils ice up and defrost cycles run every 30 to 90 minutes. Refrigerant leaks, compressor failures, and reversing valve issues often appear suddenly during peak heating or cooling demand, leaving homes without climate control when it matters most. Unlike furnaces with 20-year average lifespans, heat pumps typically last 12 to 15 years due to year-round operation and refrigerant system complexity.
  issues:
    - Outdoor units icing over excessively during Guelph's humid winter conditions indicate failing defrost sensors, low refrigerant charge, or restricted airflow, reducing heating capacity by 30% to 50% and forcing backup heating to run continuously
    - Heat pumps that blow lukewarm air during cold snaps (below minus 15 degrees Celsius) signal refrigerant charge issues or compressor wear, both requiring refrigerant handling certification to diagnose and repair properly
    - Reversing valve failures that leave heat pumps stuck in heating or cooling mode typically occur during seasonal transitions, and replacement requires evacuating and recharging the entire refrigerant system, costing $1,200 to $2,000 in parts and labor
    - Compressor failures on heat pumps older than 10 years rarely justify repair costs ($2,500 to $4,000) when new cold-climate models qualify for rebates and deliver 30% better efficiency, especially if refrigerant type is being phased out
solution:
  headline: 'Heat Pump Troubleshooting That Understands Cold-Climate Systems'
  description: 'Cold-climate heat pumps operate differently than standard models, requiring diagnostic expertise most HVAC techs lack. We service what we install and understand the defrost cycle issues, refrigerant charge requirements, and backup heat integration unique to cold-climate units. Our technicians diagnose whether problems stem from equipment failure or installation errors. You get accurate repairs that restore full heating capacity, not temporary fixes that fail next winter.'

context: |
  Guelph homeowners rely on heat pumps year-round for efficient heating and cooling, but the city's variable climate can put significant stress on these systems. In neighborhoods like the Ward, South End, and Exhibition Park, we see common issues including defrost cycle failures during cold snaps, refrigerant leaks from thermal cycling, and compressor strain from the humid summers along the Speed River corridor. Many older homes in Downtown Guelph and the historic areas have been retrofitted with ductless mini-split heat pumps, which require specialized repair knowledge. The University of Guelph area sees high demand for emergency repairs during extreme weather when students and residents depend on reliable climate control. Our technicians understand the unique challenges of Guelph's housing stock, from century homes in the Old University to newer builds in the south end, ensuring your heat pump receives expert diagnosis and lasting repairs.
