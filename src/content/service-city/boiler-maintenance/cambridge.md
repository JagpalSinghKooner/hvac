localContext: |
  Cambridge's three distinct cores of Galt, Preston, and Hespeler each contain heritage neighborhoods with traditional boiler heating systems. The historic mill town architecture along the Grand River includes many Victorian and Edwardian homes where hydronic heating remains the preferred choice. Galt's downtown heritage district and Preston's established residential streets feature homes that have relied on boiler systems for generations. Cambridge winters bring significant snowfall and extended cold periods, making reliable boiler operation essential. The city's mix of industrial heritage homes and newer developments in areas like Blair and Hespeler Village means varied boiler service needs that require experienced technicians familiar with both antique and modern systems.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Living in an 1890s home in Galt means dealing with old heating systems. B.A.P technicians actually understand our steam boiler and keep it running efficiently year after year."
