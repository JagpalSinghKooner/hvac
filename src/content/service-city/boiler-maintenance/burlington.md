localContext: |
  Burlington's lakefront location along Lake Ontario creates unique heating demands, with damp winter conditions and lake-effect weather patterns requiring reliable heating systems. The city's established neighborhoods near Downtown Burlington and the historic areas along Ontario Street feature many homes with hydronic boiler systems that provide consistent, comfortable heat. Burlington's prosperous residential areas in Roseland, Tyandaga, and along the waterfront include larger heritage homes where boiler heating is valued for its even warmth and quiet operation. The city experiences significant winter precipitation and cold snaps that test heating systems regularly. Annual boiler maintenance helps Burlington homeowners maintain efficiency and avoid the inconvenience of mid-winter heating failures when temperatures drop and lake-effect snow arrives.
