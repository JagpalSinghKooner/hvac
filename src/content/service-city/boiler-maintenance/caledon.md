localContext: |
  Caledon's sprawling rural landscape and picturesque villages are home to many estate properties and heritage farmhouses where boiler heating systems are preferred for their ability to heat large spaces efficiently. The town's communities including Bolton, Caledon East, and Caledon Village feature homes ranging from historic stone farmhouses to modern custom builds with radiant floor heating. Caledon's location on the Oak Ridges Moraine means residents experience colder temperatures and more significant snowfall than communities closer to Lake Ontario. The area's equestrian properties and country estates often feature extensive hydronic heating systems that require expert maintenance. Annual boiler service is essential for Caledon property owners who depend on reliable heating for their homes, workshops, and agricultural buildings throughout the long winter season.
