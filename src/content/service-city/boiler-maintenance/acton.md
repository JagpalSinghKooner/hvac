localContext: |
  Acton is a historic community in Halton Hills known for its leather tanning heritage and well-preserved Victorian downtown. The town's established neighborhoods along Mill Street and throughout the historic core contain many older homes where boiler heating has provided reliable warmth for over a century. Acton's location on the Niagara Escarpment means residents experience colder winters with more snowfall than communities in lower elevations. The town's heritage homes feature architectural details that complement hydronic heating systems, which provide the gentle, consistent warmth these older properties require. Many Acton homeowners have maintained their boiler systems for decades, appreciating the reliable performance and comfortable heat during the coldest winter months. Annual maintenance ensures these established heating systems continue operating safely and efficiently.

  testimonial: "Our Victorian home in downtown Acton has radiators in every room connected to a boiler that B.A.P maintains annually. The heat is comfortable and consistent, exactly what an old house like ours needs."
