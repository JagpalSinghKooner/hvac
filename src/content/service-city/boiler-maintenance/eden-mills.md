  Eden Mills is a small heritage community in Guelph-Eramosa Township famous for its annual Writers Festival and exceptionally well-preserved nineteenth century character. The village's stone homes and historic buildings along the Eramosa River feature traditional heating systems that have provided comfortable warmth for over a century. Eden Mills residents value the quiet, consistent heat that boiler systems deliver, which complements the peaceful character of this literary village. The community's location in Wellington County means residents experience cold winters with significant snowfall that demands reliable heating performance. Many Eden Mills properties are heritage homes where maintaining original character includes preserving and properly maintaining traditional hydronic heating systems. Annual boiler maintenance ensures these historic homes remain comfortable and safe throughout the winter months.
