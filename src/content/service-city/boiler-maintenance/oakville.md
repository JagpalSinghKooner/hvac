localContext: |
  Oakville's affluent neighborhoods feature many executive homes and heritage properties where hydronic boiler systems are valued for their superior comfort and quiet operation. The historic downtown core and established areas like Old Oakville, Bronte, and Morrison contain substantial older homes where boiler heating has been trusted for generations. Oakville's proximity to Lake Ontario means homeowners experience damp, cold winters with significant precipitation, making reliable heating essential. The town's high property values mean homeowners invest in proper maintenance to protect their heating systems and avoid disruptive failures. Many Oakville homes feature radiant floor heating or traditional radiator systems that require expert boiler maintenance to operate at peak efficiency throughout the heating season.
