localContext: |
  Fergus is known for its Scottish heritage and stunning nineteenth century limestone architecture along the Grand River. The historic downtown and surrounding neighborhoods contain many heritage stone homes where boiler heating has been the preferred choice since these buildings were constructed. Fergus experiences typical Wellington County winters with heavy snowfall, ice storms, and extended cold periods that demand reliable heating systems. The town's stone buildings retain heat well but require consistent boiler operation to maintain comfortable temperatures during the coldest months. Many Fergus homes feature original or updated radiator systems that provide the even, comfortable warmth these heritage properties deserve. Annual boiler maintenance is essential for Fergus homeowners preserving both the comfort and character of their historic stone homes.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our limestone home in downtown Fergus has thick stone walls that need consistent heat. B.A.P maintains our boiler annually, and the radiators keep every room comfortable even during ice storms."
