localContext: |
  Halton Hills encompasses the communities of Georgetown, Acton, and surrounding rural areas, each with distinct housing characteristics and heating needs. Georgetown's historic downtown and Acton's established neighborhoods feature numerous older homes where boiler heating systems have provided reliable warmth for decades. The rural properties throughout Halton Hills often rely on boilers for their durability and ability to heat large farmhouses effectively. The area's elevation on the Niagara Escarpment brings colder winter temperatures and significant snowfall compared to lakefront communities. Many Halton Hills properties feature estate homes with radiant heating systems that require expert boiler maintenance to ensure consistent performance throughout the long heating season.
localProof:
  testimonial: "Our farmhouse outside Georgetown has a boiler that heats the entire property including the attached workshop. B.A.P maintains it annually, and we have never had a winter breakdown despite the heavy use."
