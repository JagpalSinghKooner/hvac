localContext: |
  Elora is one of Ontario's most picturesque villages, famous for the Elora Gorge and its exceptionally well-preserved nineteenth century limestone architecture. The village's heritage buildings and stone homes along Mill Street and throughout the historic core feature traditional heating systems that complement their architectural character. Elora's location in the Grand River valley means residents experience cold, snowy winters with temperatures that regularly drop well below freezing. The village's limestone buildings require consistent, reliable heating to maintain comfortable interior temperatures during extended cold periods. Many Elora homes feature radiator systems that have provided comfortable heat for over a century. Annual boiler maintenance ensures these heritage heating systems continue performing reliably while preserving the character and comfort that make Elora homes so distinctive.
