localContext: |
  Brantford's rich industrial history has left the city with extensive neighborhoods of heritage worker housing and stately Victorian homes, many featuring traditional boiler heating systems. The historic downtown and residential areas along the Grand River contain substantial older housing stock where hydronic heating remains the preferred choice for consistent winter comfort. Brantford's Telephone City heritage includes many well-preserved homes in neighborhoods like Holmedale and West Brant where boilers have provided reliable heat for generations. The city experiences typical Southern Ontario winters with extended cold periods and significant snowfall. Annual boiler maintenance helps Brantford homeowners keep heating costs manageable while ensuring their systems operate safely and efficiently throughout the heating season.
