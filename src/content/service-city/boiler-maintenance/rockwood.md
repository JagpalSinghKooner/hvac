localContext: |
  Rockwood is a charming village in Guelph-Eramosa Township known for its historic mill, conservation area, and well-preserved nineteenth century architecture. The village's limestone buildings and heritage homes along Main Street feature traditional heating systems that have provided reliable warmth for generations. Rockwood's location along the Eramosa River and its position on the edge of the Guelph drumlin field means residents experience typical Wellington County winters with significant snowfall and cold temperatures. Many Rockwood homes feature radiator systems connected to boilers that provide the even, comfortable heat these older stone and brick buildings require. The village's character homes benefit from the gentle, consistent warmth that hydronic heating delivers. Annual boiler maintenance ensures these heritage heating systems continue performing safely and efficiently.
