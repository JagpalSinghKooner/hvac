Don't ignore these warning signs that your furnace needs professional attention:

**Call for service if you notice:**
- **Strange noises:** Banging, rattling, squealing, or grinding sounds
- **Weak airflow:** Reduced air coming from vents
- **Frequent cycling:** Furnace turns on and off repeatedly
- **Uneven heating:** Some rooms warm, others cold
- **Higher energy bills:** Sudden increase without explanation
- **Yellow pilot light:** Should be blue; yellow indicates combustion issues
- **Unusual smells:** Burning, musty, or rotten egg odors

**Call immediately if:**
- Furnace won't start at all
- No heat coming from vents
- Carbon monoxide detector activates
- You smell gas

**Why prompt repair matters:**
Small problems become expensive breakdowns when ignored. A $150 igniter replacement today prevents a $500+ emergency repair later. Regular attention also extends your furnace's lifespan.

We offer free diagnostics to assess the problem and provide honest recommendations on whether repair or replacement makes more sense for your situation.
