Ductless mini-split costs depend on the system size and configuration:

**Single-zone systems (one indoor unit):**
- Typical cost: $3,500-$6,000 installed
- Best for: One room, addition, garage, or sunroom

**Multi-zone systems (2-5 indoor units):**
- Typical cost: $8,000-$15,000+ installed
- Best for: Whole-home solution or multiple problem areas

**What affects the cost:**
- Number of indoor units (zones)
- Heating capacity (standard vs cold-climate models)
- Efficiency rating (SEER/HSPF)
- Installation complexity
- Indoor unit type (wall, ceiling, floor)

**What's included in our installation:**
- Outdoor and indoor unit(s)
- All refrigerant lines and electrical connections
- Professional installation by certified technicians

**Cost comparison:**
While the upfront cost may seem higher than window units, ductless systems are far more efficient, quieter, and provide both heating and cooling. They often qualify for rebates that reduce the net cost significantly.
