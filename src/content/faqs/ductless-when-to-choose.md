question: When should I choose a ductless mini-split over central AC?
answer: Choose ductless for homes without ductwork, room additions, converted garages, supplementing problem areas, or when you want zoned temperature control. Central AC is better for whole-home cooling with existing ductwork.

Both systems have their place. Here's when each makes sense:

**Choose ductless mini-splits when:**
- Your home has no existing ductwork
- You're adding a room addition, sunroom, or converted garage
- You have hot or cold spots your current system can't fix
- You want individual temperature control per room
- You're cooling a small home or condo
- You want to avoid the cost of installing ductwork
- Historic homes where ductwork would damage character

**Choose central AC when:**
- Your home already has good ductwork
- You want whole-home cooling with one thermostat
- You're also installing or have a forced-air furnace
- Budget is tight (central AC is often cheaper for whole-home)
- You prefer not to see indoor units on walls

**Consider both:**
Some homes benefit from central AC for main living areas plus a ductless unit for a problem zone (like an above-garage bonus room or home office).
