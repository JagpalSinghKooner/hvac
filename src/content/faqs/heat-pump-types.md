question: What's the difference between air-source and ground-source heat pumps?
answer: Air-source heat pumps extract heat from outdoor air and cost less to install. Ground-source (geothermal) heat pumps use underground temperatures for higher efficiency but require significant excavation and investment.

The two main heat pump types work differently and suit different situations:

**Air-Source Heat Pumps:**
- Extract heat from outdoor air (even in cold weather)
- Lower installation cost ($8,000-$15,000 typical)
- Faster installation (1-2 days)
- No excavation required
- Easier maintenance
- Best for: Most residential applications, budget-conscious homeowners

**Ground-Source (Geothermal) Heat Pumps:**
- Extract heat from underground (consistent 10-15°C year-round)
- Higher efficiency (300-500% vs 200-300% for air-source)
- Higher installation cost ($20,000-$40,000+ typical)
- Requires excavation for ground loops
- Lower operating costs long-term
- Best for: New construction, large properties, long-term investments

**Our recommendation:**
For most Ontario homeowners, air-source heat pumps offer the best balance of cost, efficiency, and practicality. Modern cold-climate models perform excellently in our winters.

We install both types and can help you determine which makes sense for your property, budget, and goals during your free consultation.
