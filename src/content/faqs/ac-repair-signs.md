Watch for these warning signs that your air conditioner needs professional attention:

**Common warning signs:**
- **Weak cooling:** AC runs but doesn't cool effectively
- **Warm air:** Blowing room temperature or warm air
- **Unusual noises:** Grinding, squealing, rattling, or buzzing sounds
- **Frequent cycling:** Turns on and off repeatedly (short-cycling)
- **Water leaks:** Puddles around the indoor or outdoor unit
- **Higher bills:** Electricity costs spike without increased usage
- **Strange odors:** Musty, burning, or chemical smells
- **Ice formation:** Frost or ice on the refrigerant lines or unit

**Call immediately if:**
- AC won't turn on at all
- Burning smell or visible smoke
- Electrical issues (tripping breakers)

Small issues like a dirty filter or low refrigerant can damage expensive components like the compressor if ignored. A $200 repair today can prevent a $2,000 problem later.
