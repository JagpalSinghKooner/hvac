Central air conditioner installation in Ontario typically ranges from $4,000 to $9,000+, depending on several factors:

- **Unit size (tonnage):** Larger homes need more capacity
- **SEER rating:** Higher efficiency units cost more upfront but save on energy bills
- **Installation complexity:** New installations cost more than replacements
- **Ductwork condition:** Modifications add to the total
- **Electrical requirements:** Panel upgrades if needed
