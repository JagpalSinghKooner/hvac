Air conditioner repair costs depend on what's wrong. Most common repairs fall in the $150-$700 range:

**Common repair costs:**
- Capacitor replacement: $150-$300
- Contactor replacement: $150-$350
- Refrigerant recharge: $200-$500
- Fan motor repair: $300-$600
- Compressor issues: $500-$700+ (may warrant replacement discussion)

**What affects the cost:**
- Type and cost of parts needed
- Refrigerant type (R-22 vs R-410A)
- Labour time required
- System accessibility

**Our process:**
We diagnose the problem and provide a clear, upfront price before any repair work begins. No hidden fees or surprise charges. If the repair cost approaches the value of a new unit, we'll give you honest advice about whether replacement makes more financial sense.

**Refrigerant note:**
If your AC uses R-22 (Freon), which is being phased out, repairs involving refrigerant may be expensive. We'll discuss your options, including whether upgrading to a new system with modern refrigerant makes more sense long-term.
