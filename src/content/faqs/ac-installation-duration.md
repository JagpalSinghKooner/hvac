Standard central air conditioner installation typically takes 4-8 hours for a straightforward replacement where existing ductwork and electrical connections are in good condition. For new installations or situations requiring ductwork modifications, electrical upgrades, or complex configurations, the process may take 1-2 days.

Factors that affect installation time include:
- Whether you're replacing an existing unit or installing for the first time
- Ductwork condition and any modifications needed
