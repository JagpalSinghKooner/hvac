Boiler installation in Ontario typically ranges from $5,000 to $12,000+, depending on several factors:

- **Boiler type:** Standard vs high-efficiency condensing models
- **Fuel type:** Natural gas, propane, or oil
- **System size:** Based on your home's heating requirements
- **Installation complexity:** Replacing existing vs new installation
- **Distribution system:** Radiators, baseboard, or radiant floor

**What affects the cost:**
High-efficiency condensing boilers cost more upfront but offer 90-95%+ efficiency compared to 80-85% for standard models. The energy savings often justify the higher initial investment, especially with current fuel prices.
