We recommend having your air conditioner professionally serviced once per year, ideally in spring before the cooling season begins. This timing ensures your system is ready for summer and allows time to address any issues before you need it most.

**What annual maintenance includes:**
- Cleaning condenser and evaporator coils
- Checking refrigerant levels and pressure
- Inspecting and cleaning the blower assembly
- Testing electrical connections and controls
- Lubricating moving parts
- Checking thermostat calibration
- Inspecting ductwork connections

**Benefits of regular maintenance:**
- **Fewer breakdowns:** Catch small issues before they become expensive repairs
- **Lower energy bills:** Clean, tuned systems run more efficiently
- **Longer equipment life:** Well-maintained ACs last 15-20 years vs 10-12 for neglected units
- **Better cooling:** Consistent comfort throughout your home
- **Warranty protection:** Many manufacturers require annual maintenance

**Between service visits:**
Change your air filter every 1-3 months and keep the outdoor unit clear of debris, leaves, and vegetation.
