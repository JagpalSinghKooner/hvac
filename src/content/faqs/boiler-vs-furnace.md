question: What's the difference between a boiler and a furnace?
answer: Furnaces heat air and distribute it through ductwork. Boilers heat water and distribute warmth through radiators, baseboard heaters, or radiant floor systems. Both can be highly efficient.

Furnaces and boilers both heat your home but work differently:

**Furnaces:**
- Heat air using gas, oil, or electricity
- Distribute warm air through ductwork and vents
- Faster heat-up time
- Can integrate with central AC using shared ductwork
- More common in newer Ontario homes
- Typical efficiency: 80-98% AFUE

**Boilers:**
- Heat water (or steam) using gas, oil, or electricity
- Distribute heat through radiators, baseboards, or radiant floors
- More even, consistent heat without air movement
- Quieter operation (no blower noise)
- No ductwork required
- Common in older Ontario homes
- Typical efficiency: 80-95% AFUE

**Choosing between them:**
If your home has existing ductwork and you want central AC, a furnace usually makes sense. If you prefer radiant heat, have a boiler system in place, or want to avoid ductwork, a boiler may be the better choice.

We install, repair, and maintain both systems. During your consultation, we'll help you understand which option works best for your home, budget, and comfort preferences.
