Yes, modern cold-climate heat pumps are absolutely worth it in Ontario. Today's technology has solved the "too cold to work" problem that plagued older heat pumps.

**How they perform in winter:**
- Cold-climate models work efficiently down to -25°C or colder
- Variable-speed compressors maintain comfort in extreme temperatures
- Most homes use a backup heating source (existing furnace or electric) for the coldest days

**Why Ontario homeowners choose heat pumps:**
- **Dual function:** One system provides both heating AND cooling
- **Energy savings:** 2-3x more efficient than traditional heating
- **Lower operating costs:** Significant reduction in heating bills
- **Environmental benefits:** Reduced carbon footprint
- **Rebates:** Substantial government incentives available

**The reality:**
Heat pumps handle 80-90% of Ontario's heating season efficiently. During extreme cold snaps, backup heating kicks in automatically. Many homeowners see 30-50% reductions in heating costs.
