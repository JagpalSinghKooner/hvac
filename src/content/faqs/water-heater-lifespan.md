Traditional tank water heaters typically last 8-12 years, while tankless water heaters can last 15-20 years with proper maintenance. Factors affecting lifespan include water quality, maintenance frequency, and usage patterns. Signs your water heater needs replacement include rusty water, strange noises, leaks, or inconsistent water temperature. Regular maintenance, including annual flushing and anode rod replacement, can help maximize your water heater's lifespan.
