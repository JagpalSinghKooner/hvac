Annual AC maintenance provides significant benefits that far outweigh the small investment:

**Financial benefits:**
- **Lower energy bills:** Clean systems run 15-25% more efficiently
- **Fewer repairs:** Catch small issues before they become expensive problems
- **Extended lifespan:** Well-maintained units last 15-20 years vs 10-12 without maintenance
- **Warranty protection:** Most manufacturers require annual service to maintain coverage

**Comfort benefits:**
- **Reliable cooling:** Less chance of breakdown during heat waves
- **Better performance:** Consistent temperatures throughout your home
- **Improved air quality:** Clean filters and coils mean cleaner air
- **Quieter operation:** Lubricated, adjusted components run smoothly

**Safety benefits:**
- **Electrical inspection:** Prevents fire hazards from worn connections
- **Refrigerant check:** Ensures proper levels and no leaks

**The math:**
A $150-$200 annual tune-up can prevent a $500+ emergency repair and save $200-$400 per year on energy bills. Over your AC's lifetime, regular maintenance can save thousands of dollars.

Our maintenance plans make it easy to stay on schedule and include priority service if problems arise.
