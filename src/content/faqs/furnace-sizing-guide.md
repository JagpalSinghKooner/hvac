Furnace sizing depends on several factors including your home's square footage, insulation quality, number and type of windows, ceiling height, and Ontario's climate zone. A furnace that's too small won't keep your home warm, while an oversized unit cycles on and off frequently, wasting energy and wearing out faster.

Our technicians perform a proper heat loss calculation during your free estimate to determine the correct BTU rating for your home. This ensures:

- **Consistent comfort:** No cold spots or temperature swings
- **Energy efficiency:** The furnace runs at optimal cycles
- **Equipment longevity:** Proper sizing prevents premature wear
- **Lower operating costs:** Right-sized equipment uses less fuel

As a general guideline, homes in Southern Ontario typically need 40-50 BTU per square foot, but this varies significantly based on your home's specific characteristics. Never choose a furnace size based solely on square footage—a professional assessment ensures you get the right fit.
