We install all major furnace brands including Lennox, Carrier, Goodman, Daikin, Trane, Rheem, and more. Unlike dealers tied to a single manufacturer, we're brand-independent—which means we recommend the best option for your specific situation, not the brand that pays us the most.

During your free estimate, we'll discuss:

- **Your budget:** Options range from value-oriented to premium
- **Efficiency goals:** Standard (80% AFUE) vs high-efficiency (95%+ AFUE)
- **Warranty preferences:** Different brands offer varying coverage
- **Your home's requirements:** Some brands perform better in certain applications

Every furnace we install comes with our 10-year parts and labour warranty, regardless of brand. We also service all brands, so you're never stuck if you have an existing unit from any manufacturer.
