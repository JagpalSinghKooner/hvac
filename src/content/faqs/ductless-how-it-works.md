question: How do ductless mini-split systems work?
answer: Ductless mini-splits have an outdoor compressor connected to indoor air handlers via refrigerant lines. They provide zoned heating and cooling without ductwork, making them ideal for additions, older homes, or specific rooms.

Ductless mini-split systems consist of two main components connected by refrigerant lines:

**Outdoor unit:**
- Contains the compressor and condenser
- Sits outside your home (similar to a central AC unit)
- Can connect to multiple indoor units (multi-zone systems)

**Indoor units:**
- Wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, or floor-standing
- Contain the evaporator and blower
- Each unit serves one zone/room
- Individual temperature control per zone

**How they work:**
The outdoor unit pumps refrigerant to the indoor units through small lines that pass through a 3-inch hole in the wall. The indoor units absorb heat from your room (cooling mode) or release heat into your room (heating mode). Modern units provide both heating and cooling year-round.

**Key advantages:**
- **No ductwork needed:** Perfect for homes without ducts
- **Zoned control:** Heat or cool only the rooms you're using
- **Energy efficient:** No duct losses (which waste 20-30% in conventional systems)
- **Flexible installation:** Minimal construction required
- **Quiet operation:** Whisper-quiet indoor units

Ideal for home additions, converted garages, sunrooms, older homes without ductwork, or supplementing areas your main system doesn't reach well.
