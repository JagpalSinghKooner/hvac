Several signs indicate it may be time to replace your air conditioner: your system is over 10-15 years old, frequent repairs are needed, energy bills have increased significantly, the unit struggles to cool your home effectively, or you notice unusual noises or odors. If your AC requires expensive repairs and is nearing the end of its expected lifespan, replacement is often more cost-effective than continued repairs.
