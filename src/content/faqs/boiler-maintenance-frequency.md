Boilers should be professionally serviced once per year, ideally in fall before the heating season begins. Annual maintenance is essential for safety, reliability, and efficiency.

**What annual boiler maintenance includes:**
- Inspecting and cleaning the heat exchanger
- Checking and adjusting burner operation
- Testing safety controls and pressure relief valves
- Inspecting the flue and venting system
- Checking water pressure and expansion tank
- Testing for carbon monoxide
- Lubricating pumps and motors
- Bleeding radiators if needed

**Why annual service matters:**
- **Safety:** Combustion issues can produce carbon monoxide
- **Reliability:** Catch problems before heating season
- **Efficiency:** Clean systems use less fuel
- **Longevity:** Well-maintained boilers last 20-30 years
- **Warranty:** Many manufacturers require annual service

**Warning signs between services:**
- Unusual noises (banging, whistling, gurgling)
- Radiators not heating evenly
- Visible leaks or corrosion
- Higher than normal fuel bills
- Pilot light issues or frequent cycling

If you notice any of these, don't wait for your annual service—call for an inspection.
