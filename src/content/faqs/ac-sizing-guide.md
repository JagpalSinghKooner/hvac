Air conditioner sizing is measured in tons, where 1 ton equals 12,000 BTU of cooling capacity. The correct size depends on:

- **Square footage:** Larger homes need more capacity
- **Insulation quality:** Poor insulation requires more cooling
- **Window size and direction:** South-facing windows add heat
- **Ceiling height:** Higher ceilings mean more air volume
- **Number of occupants:** More people generate more heat

**Why proper sizing matters:**
- **Undersized:** Can't keep up on hot days, runs constantly, higher bills
- **Oversized:** Short-cycles, poor humidity control, uneven cooling, wastes energy

Our technicians perform a proper cooling load calculation during your free estimate. This considers all factors to recommend the exact tonnage your home needs—not a rough guess based on square footage alone.

Most Ontario homes need between 2 and 5 tons. We'll explain our sizing recommendation so you understand exactly why it's right for your home.
