question: What SEER rating should I choose for my air conditioner?
answer: SEER measures AC efficiency. Minimum is 14 SEER, but 16-18+ SEER units offer better energy savings. Higher SEER costs more upfront but lowers your electricity bills and often qualifies for rebates.

SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) measures how efficiently an air conditioner converts electricity into cooling. Higher numbers mean better efficiency.

**Common SEER ratings:**
- **14-15 SEER:** Minimum efficiency, lowest upfront cost
- **16-17 SEER:** Good balance of cost and efficiency
- **18-21+ SEER:** Premium efficiency, maximum energy savings

**Choosing the right SEER:**
Consider how much you use your AC. If you run it frequently through summer, a higher SEER unit pays for itself faster through lower electricity bills. If you use it sparingly, a mid-range unit may be more economical.

**Rebate consideration:**
High-efficiency units (typically 16+ SEER) often qualify for government and utility rebates that can significantly offset the higher purchase price. We handle all rebate paperwork for you.
