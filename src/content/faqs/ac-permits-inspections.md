Yes, we handle all required permits and schedule inspections as part of our installation service. You don't need to deal with any paperwork or municipal offices—we take care of everything.

**What we handle:**
- Pulling all necessary permits before installation begins
- Scheduling and coordinating inspections with local authorities
- Ensuring all work meets Ontario Building Code requirements
- Providing documentation for your records

**Why permits matter:**
Permits ensure your installation meets safety codes and protects your home insurance coverage. Unpermitted work can create problems when selling your home or filing insurance claims.

**Electrical requirements:**
If your AC installation requires electrical panel upgrades or new circuits, we coordinate with licensed electricians and handle those permits as well.

All permit fees are included in your quoted price—no surprise charges. Our TSSA-certified technicians ensure every installation passes inspection the first time.
