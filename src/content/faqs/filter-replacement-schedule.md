Most standard 1-inch filters should be replaced every 1-3 months, depending on factors like pets, allergies, and system usage. Thicker filters (4-5 inches) typically last 6-12 months. Check your filter monthly and replace it when it appears dirty. Regular filter changes improve indoor air quality, reduce energy costs, and prevent strain on your HVAC system. We can recommend the best filter replacement schedule for your specific situation during a maintenance visit.
