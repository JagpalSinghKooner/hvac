Common signs that your furnace may need replacing include:

- **Age:** Most furnaces last 15-20 years. If yours is approaching or past this age, replacement is often more cost-effective than ongoing repairs.
- **Frequent repairs:** If you're calling for repairs multiple times per season, the costs add up quickly.
- **Rising energy bills:** An inefficient furnace works harder and uses more fuel, increasing your heating costs.
- **Uneven heating:** Cold spots or temperature fluctuations throughout your home indicate declining performance.
- **Strange noises:** Banging, rattling, or squealing sounds often signal worn components.
- **Yellow pilot light:** A yellow flame instead of blue can indicate a carbon monoxide issue—call immediately.

We offer free diagnostics to assess your furnace's condition and provide honest recommendations. Our technicians will explain your options clearly so you can make an informed decision.
