  text: "After 15 years of window units, we can't believe we waited this long. B.A.P figured out how to connect to our existing furnace and even added a duct run to our home office that was always hot. The whole house is the same temperature now, and we barely hear it running."

The Patels reached out after another brutal summer. Their 1970s split-level had no existing central air, and they'd been using window units for 15 years.

Our assessment revealed their existing ductwork could support central air with some modifications. We performed a Manual J load calculation to properly size the system for their 1,800 sq ft home.

The Lennox XC16 two-stage system provides excellent efficiency and ultra-quiet operation. We added a dedicated supply run to their home office on the upper level, which had always been the hottest room.

Installation took two days, including all ductwork modifications. The Patels now enjoy consistent 72-degree comfort throughout their home at a lower cost than their old window units.
