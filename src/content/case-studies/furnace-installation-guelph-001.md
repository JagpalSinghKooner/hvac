testimonial:
  text: "We were dreading another winter with that old furnace. B.A.P didn't just replace it - they actually calculated what size we needed instead of just matching the old one. Our heating bills dropped from $400 to $230 a month, and the house has never been this comfortable."

The Hendersons contacted us after their furnace failed during a cold snap. Their 25-year-old mid-efficiency unit had been struggling for years, but two breakdowns in one winter was the final straw.

Our technician performed a complete heat loss calculation - something the previous company never did. We discovered their old furnace was actually oversized for their well-insulated home, causing short cycling and uneven heating.

We recommended a Lennox SL280V variable-speed furnace at 80,000 BTU (down from their 100,000 BTU unit). The variable-speed blower provides consistent airflow and dramatically improved comfort.

Installation was completed in one day, including ductwork modifications to improve airflow to their second floor. The result: even temperatures throughout the house and heating bills that dropped by over 40%.
