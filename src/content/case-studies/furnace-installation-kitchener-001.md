During a routine fall tune-up at the Wong residence, our technician discovered a crack in the heat exchanger. This is a serious safety issue that can allow carbon monoxide to enter the home.

We immediately shut down the unit and explained the situation. With temperatures forecast to drop below -10°C that weekend and two young children in the home, time was critical.

Fortunately, we had a Lennox EL196V in stock at our warehouse. Our installation team was able to complete the full replacement the very next day.

The new high-efficiency unit not only keeps the family safe but delivers 38% better efficiency than their old unit. We also helped them apply for the Enbridge rebate, saving them an additional $400.
